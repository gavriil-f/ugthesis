{"path":"Attachments/w6-k&r-marked-essay.docx","text":"In what sense, if any, do races exist? Gavriil Fakih Trinity 2024 Race exists. It does not exist in the biological sense of the word, but in the social sense. I make this case by first debunking in length the biological account of race. Neither phenotypes, nor genotypes can be identified as adequate essences that would warrant an account of race as a biological kind. I next consider one plausibly tentative alternative—that of race as ancestral populations. However, on the basis that this does not seem to comport with race as we know it, I reject this account. I conclude by outlining a social constructivist theory of race that thus sees race as existing in the social sense. I would focus on what is philosophically interesting. So don’t spend too long on showing there’s no suitable biological kind. 1\tRaces, in the biological sense? I begin, as is perhaps traditional in the metaphysic of race, by debunking the existence of race in the biological sense. 2.1\tNatural kinds Biological realism about a given entity X can be understood as the view that Xs are biological kinds. Thus, it follows that we should apply our biological classifications of kinds to Xs. In biology, we divide living organisms by domain (eukarya, archaea, bacteria), by kingdom (animals, plants, fungi, etc.), by phylum, and so on, until we get to individual species (humans, tigers, wolves, etc.) and subspecies, such as the domestic chicken or Bengal tiger. Well there are other biological kinds too – lungs, mutations, survival advantages, reproduction. It’s not just species. Each of the various biological kinds classified is its own distinct natural kind. In the traditional account, these natural kinds are to be understood, generally, as ‘classifications of objects that corresponds to objective joints in nature’ (Ney 2023, 137). What this is to say is that that each of these kinds has a distinct essence, i.e. a set of features that make something the kind of thing or particular object that it is. This view entails then that there are properties each individual member of a kind possesses, and these properties may be understood as providing a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for membership of their given natural kind. More explicitly, we can formulate it as so: any entity E is a member of the natural kind K iff E consists in a set of intrinsic features FK that all, and only, members of K share. We may say, for instance, that the set of intrinsic features both necessary and sufficient for membership of the natural kind silver is having exactly 47 protons each. Perhaps the features to be classed in the natural kind Bengal tiger are, likewise, a certain genetic makeup and/or certain physiological characteristics. It may help you to have a bit more background on natural kinds outside the race debate. Check out Routledge, Compass or Stanford on natural kinds. Ney has the idea of causal nexus I recall. You’ll want a grasp of that. 2.2\tPhenotypes and genotypes? What the biological realist says, then, is that races can be classified by their distinct essences. These essences are commonly identified with either a common phenotype—i.e. a set of observable morphological and/or characterological features—or a common genotype—i.e. a set of genetic features. A number of candidate sets of phenotypic features have historically been identified. These range from the morphological—skin colour, skull shape, eye shape, hair type—to the characterological—certain significant and fundamental intellectual, cultural, moral characteristics. This latter account of phenotype can be termed racialism. For concreteness, this holds that differences in races are not merely superficial morphological features but extend also into the characterological realm (Mills 1998, 46). Appiah (1996) similarly defines it as the view that, … we [can] divide human beings into a small number of groups, called 'races', in such a way that the members of these groups share certain fundamental, heritable, physical, moral, intellectual, and cultural characteristics with one another that they did not share with members of any other race. (Appiah 1996, 54) There are two additional complications to this position (ibid, 55–56). Firstly, as in animal classification, 'defective' members (in the case of humans the disabled, etc.) are not to be counted against the races, and there exist separate norms for male and female members of the species. Second, these characteristics are to be thought as tendencies or dispositions, so 'the failure of an individual to fit the norm for her race would not by itself refute the theory' (ibid, 55) Note also that, in the name of rigour, we should distinguish this position from racism simpliciter. Racism may, in the strictest sense, refer to an acceptance of a natural biological hierarchy of races, whereas racialism, in the restricted sense, makes no such overt claim. Racism likely always presumes racialism, but it does not necessarily follow from racialism. In any looser sense, however, it is appropriate (if not called for) to relax this distinction and equate a racialist claim with a racist one. Setting aside the ethical question, what is ontologically problematic for the racialist view—and indeed the phenotypic account of racial essences more broadly—is that it is simply not possible to individuate races on phenotype alone. Whilst there exist broad generalisations that, to some extent, track the different races—skin colour for instance—there is no combination of observable features that are essential to the membership of a given race. Moreover, 'there is greater variety in phenotypical ... racial traits within any of the major races in society than between or among them' (Zack 2017, 381). For instance, some white people have darker skin than some white people (Jablonski 2012); some white people also have more noticeable epicanthic folds (skin folds of the upper eyelid) than some Asian people (see e.g. Jens Byggmark, the Swedish skier). But doesn’t your point “Second, these characteristics are to be thought as tendencies or dispositions, so 'the failure of an individual to fit the norm for her race would not by itself refute the theory' (ibid, 55)” address this? I guess the more powerful point is that the generalisations themselves are not true. (as with the genotypic account) Plus the idea that this is not an underlying fundamental essence that does scientific work to causally explain something else biological (as “fish” does but “vertebrate creature that lives in water” does not. (as with genotypic account) Returning then to the genotypic account of races, this view would hold that there is a particular genetic profile that forms the essence of the races, i.e. that a particular genetic profile is shared by all white people, that is different from that of black people, that is different from that of Asian people, etc. But a multitude of scientific evidence disproves this claim. Not only are today's humans, on average, 99.9% identical at the genetic level (Duello et al. 2021), but, as with phenotype, there has long been scientific consensus that there is more genetic variation within races than between them (Nei and Roychoudhury 1972; Collins, Morgan, and Patrinos 2003). Indeed, if either the phenotypic or genotypic accounts did hold, then this would entail that the different races ought to be biologically classified as different subspecies of Homo sapiens. But, given the evidence against this, Duello et al. (2021) conclude 'the species Homo sapiens cannot be further subdivided into subspecies which are physically and genetically different. Thus, for H.sapiens, the species and subspecies are the same—H.sapiens sapiens' (ibid, 233). On this note, we may question why this indeed the case. Why should does biological variation, in, say, skin colour not correlate with other characteristics, whether phenotypic or genetic? Whilst this question is firmly in the realm of biologists, Appiah (Appiah 1996, 71–72) offers us several potential answers. First, it may be the case that other traits were selected for by pressures not correlated with the pressures that gave us different skin colours. Second, it may be that certain mechanisms aimed at maintaining groups genetic stability, so there has been no notable diversion in populations' other traits. Lastly, it may be down to the simple fact that humans have continuously exchanged genes (via interbreeding) across populations for hundreds of thousands of years. All this is to say is that we should not expect to find such differences in human populations. 2.3\tPopulations? What more could a biological realist offer us? An alternative account of racial essence concerning migration patterns may be proposed. Under this view, races can be understood as 'ancestor-descendent sequences of breeding populations, or groups of such sequences, that share a common origin' (Andreasen 1998, 200). The basic idea then is that, in the distant past, different groups of people settled in distinct regions of the planet. As such, we find groups, 'anchored in a region circumscribed by major geographic barriers to human interbreeding' (Spencer 2019, 99). These geographic barriers might include the oceans, deserts, or mountain ranges. What can then be constructed is a parallel between five such human continental populations, and the major races that we typically identify in the anglosphere: whites in Eurasia, blacks in Africa, Asians in East Asia, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders in Oceania. To back up this claim, Spencer uses the work of Rosenberg et al. (2002) that seems to suggest that we can indeed identify genetic clusters suggestive of individuals' geographical origins. 2.4\tMismatches A critical problem, however, surfaces on closer inspection of Spencer’s particular interpretation of Rosenberg et al.'s (2002) findings. Not only do the authors not make any racial claim whatsoever, but elsewhere Rosenberg et al. (2005) have explicitly rejected any potential racial implications of their work, writing that it 'should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of \"biological race\"' (ibid, 668). Moreover, Spencer does not merely read between the lines, he in fact misinterprets the subject of the authors’ work (Wills 2017). Not sure much argumentatively useful in this para. Maybe Rosenberg wouldn’t want it interpreted that way but that doesn’t show Spencer has it wrong. To illustrate: Spencer wants to ground his theory of races as the ancestral legacies of distinct populations which can stably be mapped onto social groups by appeal to certain distinguishable genotypic/phenotypic traits. As already identified, this puts him in the camp of biological racial realism. Yet, the evidence suggested by Rosenburg et al. (2002) only supports a bio-genomic cluster realism, as Kaplan and Winther (2014) term it. This is the view that certain population human populations structures exist, as assessed through genomic or anthropomorphic measures (Kaplan and Winther 2014, 1040). What is missing, crucially, from the work of Rosenberg and his collaborators is any correlation between these genomically-identified population structures and self-identified racial identity. But if no empirical validation of such correlation can be offered, then the theory seems to break down as early as this, since we usually think it is important for the metaphysics of race to track, broadly, individuals’ self-recognised race (in their own home context). Bit heavily written. I’m sure you could make the point more simply without the technical jargon. But perhaps I have an unusually strong preference for Orwell’s style recommendations. In any case, try to explain why our judgements about phenotype/genotype/self-identity couldn’t be wrong (just as FISH turned out not to apply to whales). Also distinguish the point about self-identity from genotype/pheno More generally, a related objection can be levied against likeminded ‘population realists’ who cite the same or similar scientific research (see e.g. Sesardic 2010). This objection, termed the mismatch objection by Mallon (2006, 533; but see also Glasgow 2009, 94–97), highlights that ‘the very populations that are identified as genetic clusters don’t always map onto commonsense racial categories’ (Glasgow 2009, 95). For instance, we would not merge Chinese with New Guineans into a single race, as data on genetic clusters would require us (Risch et al. 2002, 5–6). Similarly, consider the common convention in the United States (as entrenched in the racial categories of the U.S. census) to consider Hispanics as a distinct race. Under the population account, we would therefore expect to see evidence of a distinct Hispanic population, but research instead shows them to be admixtures of other breeding populations (Risch et al. 2002). Underlying the force of this objection is the point that, if we are to in fact accept the bio-genomic cluster account, then race would be an objective (at least in the intersubjective sense), empirically verifiable, fact. What we identify as, what society indeed deems is a race, or what the causal potency of the racial identity is, would not matter against the verifiable biological fact of race. Ooh. You pile a lot of different distinctions together in a shrot space. This is actually philosophy so dive into this a bit more. They aren’t all the same and they each need a bit of explanation/examination. I’d rather you spent time on this than the biological/anthropological intricacies.In fact, Andreasen (1998, 213) claims this very view, writing that ‘the existence of biological races does not depend on our folk taxonomy being right.’ Ok so how do we settle that? But not only does this seem worryingly arbitrary, but it also has the added bizarre effect of invalidating any lay, or indeed any historical, talk of race. Essentially, it commits us to saying that those who refer to, say, Hispanics, as a race do not know what they are talking about; their understanding of the word ‘race’ is wrong. Relatedly, it would establish that there is only one correct racial classification. Yet systems of racial classification have varied wildly throughout time and geography. Consider even the variance in modern classifications. The U.S. government recognises the five races mentioned earlier, but Brazil recognises a different five; Branco (White), Pardo (Brown), Preto (Black), Amarelo (Yellow), and Indígena (Indigenous) (IBGE 2022). In even starker contrast, South Africa recognises only four, and the Indian census recognises none (Ney 2023, 163). As such, it seems to commit us to the view that all of these established conventions are wrong, bar perhaps one. Perhaps most critically, however, the position would also admit that past speakers who uttered the word before this scientifically informed population cluster model were wrong. Appiah makes the following point, '[f]rom Jefferson to [Matthew] Arnold, the idea of race has been used, in its application to humans, in such a way as to require that there be significant correlations between the biological and the moral, literary, or psychological characters of human beings; and that these be explained by the intrinsic nature … of the members of the race’ (Appiah 1992, 71) And yet, as I have established, there are no such correlations that can be made. So then, ultimately, no matter how scientifically clever the biological realist would like to get, her account will always require abandoning a very basic (‘ideational’ in Appiah’s words) assumption that most of take for granted: that people know what they mean by race. 🡨 yes Is this assumption fair? I think it is; typically in philosophy we shape and test our theories against intuitional data. Thus, the sharp conflict of this account against our intuition (that most people know what they’re talking about when the talk of ‘race’) ought to count against it, to some degree at least. Note, though, that on its own this principle is not a knock-down argument. What strengthens it, however, is the fact that race has historically been, and continues to be, incredibly causally potent, i.e. racial classification has genuine and significant social, financial, mental, political, and so on, effects. If, however, we were to accept a metaphysics of race that explicitly ran contrary to the way ‘race’ is used in current society, we would no longer be able to make sense of its causal potency. Good and why doesn’t this apply to other notions. What is this causal potency if it isn’t the racialist one? To illustrate this point, I will draw inspiration from a thought experiment in Mills (1998). Consider a society with individuals of races R1 and R2. The society is also a R1 supremacist system, being structured as a vertical racial hierarchy where R1s enjoy relative special privilege, and R2s are actively discriminated against / marginalised / dominated. But now, imagine that metaphysicians, or biologists, in the society discover that there is no biological element to the established racial division. Instead, they find evidence of a (perhaps completely) uncorrelated biological element—the quace. Given that they accept these findings as the metaphysical, biological truth, would it in any way make sense for them to speak of ‘quacial’ discrimination when describing the hierarchical status quo? Clearly not. The hierarchy is not structured around a quacial hierarchy but a racial one, which has nothing to do with it. But if the metaphysicians are strict in their vocabulary, and refuse to believe in anything that they know is essentially false (in the essence sense from earlier), how are they to describe the ongoing racial division? They cannot refer to the races of individuals, since these are false notions, nor even to racial discrimination, since this presupposes the existence of race on which to discriminate. But clearly, something still persists in this society that—perhaps that is race in the social sense, as a mental object. 🡨 much better 3\tRaces, in the social sense or no sense at all? This leads us nicely to the conception of race in the social sense. I have, so far, established that any biological definition of race as we know it is, empirically, completely unfounded. And the only potentially tentative account of race in the biological sense, that which tracks ancestral populations, would have abandon the way the term is embedded and used within society. It would commit us to a logical incoherence between the concept and its typical referent in society (James and Burgos 2024). Here, racial sceptics like Appiah (1992; 1996) and Zack (2017) would have us adopt a normative eliminativism, arguing to discard the concept entirely. But an alternative is to adopt a social constructionist view. The basic idea here is to point out that, despite race not existing simpliciter, i.e. in the biological sense, race still exists in a social sense. There exist stable patterns of racial classifications in real societies, suggesting that in the absence of a biological marker we should view races as social kinds. To say races are social kinds is to say, roughly, that their existence depends on social practices and institutions. Consider another social kind; money, for instance. Ever since the termination of the gold standard, the value of money is not intrinsically defined by any concrete feature out in the world, but by social institutions of trust, of supply, of demand, etc. Still, it would be strange to argue that there exists no money in the world. It might not be defined in any mind-independent terms, but it can still exist objectively in an intersubjective sense, i.e. in some idealised sense we can all agree that money does, indeed, exist. How do we describe such a social constructivist account of race? Mills (1998) offers us one description, arguing along the lines that the existence of races comes about when people are classified on the basis of certain evolutionary histories, and are then subject to privilege or oppression on this basis. As such, Mills concludes that, … race is a contingently deep reality that structures our particular social universe, having a social objectivity and causal significance that arise out of our particular history. (Mills 1998, 48) Haslanger gives us a more explicit formulation, writing that, [a] group is racialized iff its members are socially positioned as subordi- nate or privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and the group is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of ancestral links to a certain geographical region (Haslanger 2012, 236) Such constructivist views can be motivated by two philosophical principles that I have so far loosely described, but not yet identified. Firstly, the Eleatic Principle, i.e. the principle ‘that the entities that are real are those that are causally potent’(Ney 2023, 165). It should be uncontentious that race can significantly affect people’s lives in every which way; from economics, to politics, to social relations. Racial differences affect the ways members of those races are treated, they affect the way racialised members view themselves, and so on. Race is thus causally potent. And, according to this principle, it follows that race exists in some sense or another. Another motivating factor may be the adoption of an ameliorative approach to social ontology. This implies us identifying and seeking to overcome certain injustices in the world. As remarked earlier, abandoning race as a concept would undercut the potential value and justice that can be achieved by racialising our politics. Those theoretical metaphysicians who disproved the existence of races but discovered quaces do not possess this capacity. One particular issue that may be presented by the eliminativist in objection, however, is the prospect that by accepting and, in effect, perpetuating racial classification we are giving the (ongoing) legacy of racism a central place in our metaphysics. After all, racial classification was devised in an explicitly racist context to serve an explicitly racist end. To this we may appeal to a Machievallian distinction between is and ought. Perhaps, however, in a world where race-based injustice no longer existed, racial classification would cease to retain its ameliorative utility and thus race would cease to exist. But we do not live in such a world. We live in a racialised world, and to adequately resolve this we need to be able to accept the existence of race, as per the ameliorative approach. 5\tConclusion Race does not exist in the biological sense. It would be tempting to reject the existence of race once we abandon this biological conception of the term. However, this would (1) fail to account for its causal potency, and (2) provide a roadblock to an ameliorative approach to social ontology. As such, we should accept that race exists in the social sense References Andreasen, Robin O. 1998. ‘A New Perspective on the Race Debate’.
