In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. A Market for Lemons (Acknowledgement to David de Meza) Four qualities of a certain brand of car are produced in equal numbers. There are two groups of potential consumers, none of whom wants to own more than a single car. Three times as many are type X as are type Y . The two types place diﬀerent values on each grade of car, summarised in the table below. The price of a new car is £16,000, and in the eyes of each consumer no depreciation occurs in the ﬁrst six months after the car has left the factory. Quality Type X value Type Y value (£,000) (£,000) A 21 18 B 18 17 C 15 16 D 11 12 (a) Who buys new cars, assuming that they discover the grade only after purchase? (b) Analyse the market for six month resales, continuing to assume that consumers are able to judge the quality of a speciﬁc car only after purchase, but that they do know the average quality of used cars traded – i.e. if potential buyers oﬀer a price of £20,000, they know that any type Y owner would sell, but that the type X owners would sell only if their car was grade B, C, or D. (Each potential trader decides whether or not to trade a single used car at the prevailing price and no later resales are possible.) (c) If both buyers and sellers knew the quality of every used car traded, who would be better oﬀ than in part (b), and who would be worse oﬀ? 2. Adverse Selection I Three qualities of second-hand bicycles are available in equal numbers. Type X con- sumers and type Y consumers have diﬀerent values for each quality of bicycle: Quality Type X value Type Y value High 90 110 Medium 80 85 Low 70 60 (a) If a social planner were allocating the bicycles, which type of consumer would own which quality bicycle? Now assume that type X consumers own the bicycles (they are potential sellers), but type Y consumers do not (they are potential buyers). 1 (b) If both sellers and buyers know the quality of each bicycle, what will be the market equilibrium outcome? (c) If neither sellers nor buyers know the quality of any bicycle, what will be the market equilibrium outcome? (d) Finally, suppose that buyers do not know the quality of any particular bicycle for sale, but sellers do know the quality of the one that they own. (However, buyers do know the average quality of bicycles that would be traded at any given price.) What will be the market equilibrium outcome? (e) Comment on the eﬃciency, or otherwise, of the outcomes in settings (a)–(d). 3. Adverse Selection II Three bicycles are available, one of each quality. There are three type X consumers and three type Y consumers that value each quality of bicycle diﬀerently: Quality Type X value Type Y value High 50 60 Medium 50 30 Low 20 30 (Type X’s are indiﬀerent between high and medium quality bikes, whereas type Y ’s are indiﬀerent between medium and low quality bikes. No-one wants more than one.) The price at which any bike is traded will be determined by supply and demand. (a) Suppose that type X consumers initially own the bicycles – one each. If all the consumers know the quality of each bicycle, what will be the equilibrium outcome? From now on, assume that buyers do not know the quality of any particular bicycle for sale, but sellers do know the quality of the one that they own. (However, buyers do know the average quality of bicycles that would be traded at any given price.) (b) Continue to suppose that type X consumers initially have one bike each. What will be the equilibrium outcome? (c) Now suppose that type Y consumers initially own the bicycles – one each. If the consumers believe that they can trade only once, what will be the equilibrium outcome? (d) Finally, after the market in part (c) has closed, and any new owner of a bike now knows the quality they bought, the market unexpectedly reopens for one ﬁnal round of trading. What will be the equilibrium outcome? 2 4. Signalling and Education I (Acknowledgement to Gravelle & Rees) There are two types of worker, Alphas with productivity of 15 units and Gammas with productivity of 5 units. There is the same number of each type. Production takes place in perfectly competitive ﬁrms. (a) Assume that employers cannot assess the productivity of individual workers, but they do know the average productivity of the workforce. What will be the wage structure and output of the economy? (b) Now suppose that the workers, who know their own type, can take a course. If they do, Alphas will obtain a degree, but Gammas will never pass, and this is generally known. If the monetary equivalent of the cost of eﬀort put into taking the course is 2 units, show that there is a unique pure-strategy equilibrium, in which Alphas take the course and Gammas do not. What will be the wage structure and output of the economy, net of the cost of eﬀort? (c) If the cost of the course were 6 units, how would things change? (There are two pure-strategy equilibria – one in which everyone expects no-one to take the course, and one in which everyone expects just Alphas to take the course.) (d) Reverting to the situation where the cost of the course is 2 units, what would happen if individual workers did not know their own type? (Again, check two cases – one in which everyone expects no-one to take the course, and one in which everyone expects everyone to take the course. Assume that ﬁrms cannot observe whether or not a worker has taken the course, and that they can only distinguish between workers who have “Pass” certiﬁcates and those that do not – any worker that has taken the course and failed is indistinguishable from workers that haven’t taken the course.) 5. Signalling and Education II There are two types of worker: L-types with low productivity θL , and H-types with high productivity θH ; each worker knows their own type. Many risk-neutral ﬁrms compete for the services of the workers, but they cannot observe a worker’s type. (a) Explain why some of the workers would like to be able to signal their type to the ﬁrms. What would make the signal credible? Suppose that θL = 80, θH = 100, and that there are three times as many L-types as H-types; the workers have no outside opportunities. (b) What is the market equilibrium outcome if no signal is available? (c) Suppose the workers can acquire an education, observable by the ﬁrms. This would cost 22 for an L-type, but only 12 for an H-type. Characterise the unique market equilibrium. (d) How would the analysis in part (c) change if education costs were 18 for an L-type, and 16 for an H-type? (e) Is signalling socially wasteful? 3 6. Principal-Agent I A risk-neutral principal can hire a risk-averse agent to undertake a project. There are two possible outcomes for the gross proﬁt of the principal, πL < πH; assume throughout that πL = 60. There are also two possible eﬀort levels that the agent can exert, e = 0 or 1; if e = 0, the probability of πH is only 2/5, but if e = 1, the probability of πH increases to 3/5. The agent’s utility from receiving a wage w and exerting eﬀort e is √ w − e, and the agent has a reservation utility of 8. (a) Observable eﬀort In this case, w can depend on e directly, and the contract will specify the eﬀort level (0 or 1) and the wage to be paid by the principal to the agent. Let we denote the optimal wage associated with eﬀort e. • What are w0 and w1? • When πH = 195, is the optimal contract {0, w0} or {1, w1}? • What about when πH = 165? • What if πH = 135? (b) Unobservable eﬀort Now, the contract between the two parties cannot have w depend on e directly, but it can depend on the outcome πj, j = L, H. Thus a contract will be of the form {w(πL), w(πH)}, where w(πj) is the wage paid by the principal to the agent if the gross proﬁt is πj. • Explain why the optimal way to induce e = 0 is for the principal to oﬀer the agent w0 (from part (a)) regardless of the outcome π. • By considering the Individual Rationality and Incentive Compatibility con- straints, determine the optimal way to induce e = 1. What is the expected wage in this case? • What is the optimal contract when πH = 195? • . . . and when πH = 165? • . . . and ﬁnally if πH = 135? (c) For each value of πH that you have considered, compare the optimal contract in part (b) with that in part (a). 4 7. Principal-Agent II A risk-neutral principal can hire a risk-averse agent to undertake a project. There are two possible outcomes for the gross proﬁt of the principal, πL = 20 and πH = 50. There are also two possible eﬀort levels that the agent can exert, e = 0 or 1; if e = 0, the probability of πH is only 1/3, but if e = 1, the probability of πH increases to 2/3. The agent’s utility from receiving a wage wand exerting eﬀort e is √ w − e, and the agent has a reservation utility of ¯u = 2. (a) Assume that eﬀort is observable. What wage will the principal oﬀer if she wants to induce low eﬀort? What wage will she oﬀer if she wants to induce high eﬀort? What contract is optimal for the principal? Now assume that eﬀort is unobservable, so the contract between the two parties cannot have w depend on e directly, but it can depend on the outcome πj, j = L, H. Thus a contract will be of the form {w(πL), w(πL)}, where w(πj) is the wage paid by the principal to the agent if the gross proﬁt is πj. (b) i. What is the optimal way for the principal to induce low eﬀort? ii. What is the optimal way for the principal to induce high eﬀort? What is the expected wage in this case? What is the agency cost? iii. What is the optimal contract? (c) Continue to assume that eﬀort is unobservable, but suppose the two possible outcomes for the gross proﬁt of the principal become πL = 24 and πH = 42. How does the optimal contract diﬀer from that in part (b)? 5 8. Principal-Agent: Parametric Example A risk-neutral principal can hire a risk-averse agent to undertake a project. There are two possible outcomes for the gross proﬁt of the principal, πL < πH, and two possible eﬀort levels that the agent can exert, e = 0 or 1; when e = 0, the probability of πL is greater than 1/2, and when e = 1, the probability of πH is greater than 1/2. Assume for the moment that the principal prefers to specify e = 0 when eﬀort is observable. Explain why she would not want to oﬀer a contract that induces e = 1 when eﬀort is unobservable. Now assume that the principal prefers to specify e = 1 when eﬀort is observable. There are two possibilities for her when eﬀort is unobservable: either (a) she still prefers to induce e = 1, or (b) she now prefers to induce e = 0. Explain why her expected net proﬁt falls in each case, when compared with the observable-eﬀort case. Which fall is bigger, that in (a) or that in (b)? 9. Principal-Agent: Size of the Agency Cost Suppose that eﬀort is not observable, and that a risk-neutral Principal and a risk- averse Agent have an optimal contract. What determines the size of the loss that the Principal incurs when eﬀort is unobservable compared with when eﬀort is observable? 10. Principal-Agent: Linear Contracts A risk neutral principal hires an agent who can exert eﬀort e = eL or eH, with eL < eH. The gross proﬁt of the principal, π(e), is either low or high, πL < πH, and high eﬀort makes high proﬁt more likely. The agent prefers high wages to low wages, but dislikes exerting eﬀort; their outside option would give them a level of utility ¯u. The principal is going to choose a contract of the form w(π) = a + bπ that speciﬁes the wage associated with each possible realisation of gross proﬁt, and ensures that the agent does not prefer their outside option. (a) What trade-oﬀ does the principal typically face? (b) Explain how the principal would determine the optimal contract if the agent were risk neutral. (c) Explain how the principal would determine the optimal contract if the agent were risk averse and eﬀort were observable (and contractible)? (d) Now assume that the agent is risk averse and eﬀort is unobservable. In comparison with part (c), who is better oﬀ or worse oﬀ now that eﬀort is unobservable, and why? 6 Essay-style Questions 1. When does private information result in ineﬃciency? 2. “Educational degrees and product warranties can perform similar functions.” Discuss. 3. “When prospective employees are able to signal their ability, employers are no better oﬀ, employees with lower productivity are deﬁnitely worse oﬀ, and even employees with higher productivity might be worse oﬀ.” Do you agree? Does it follow that removing the ability to signal would result in a Pareto improvement? 4. Can you rank the following three situations in terms of welfare? (a) workers are privately informed of their productivity, but cannot signal this cred- ibly; (b) workers are privately informed of their productivity, and have access to a costly signal; (c) workers are privately informed of their productivity, and ﬁrms are also informed of the productivity of each worker. 5. In the context of moral hazard, how does the agent’s level of risk-aversion aﬀect the agency cost the principal faces? What other factors inﬂuence the size of the agency cost? 6. When does an optimal contract between a principal and an agent exhibit a trade-oﬀ between insurance and incentives, and when does it not? 7. “Since people can always be induced to work hard with suﬃcient provision of incen- tives, moral hazard is not a problem.” Discuss. 8. When a risk-neutral Principal hires an Agent, what conditions will lead to eﬃcient contracts? When these conditions fail, who suﬀers from the loss in eﬃciency, and why? 9. A risk-neutral principal oﬀers a risk-averse worker a proﬁt-sharing contract: when the gross proﬁt is π the agent receives a wage w = a + bπ and the principal keeps the rest. What factors determine the principal’s choice of a and b, and how do these aﬀect her net proﬁt? 7 10. Explain how adverse selection may aﬀect outcomes in an insurance market. What sort of equilibrium could occur and does an equilibrium always exist? 11. In the standard Rothschild-Stiglitz model of the competitive provision of insurance, what are the circumstances under which no equilibrium exists? When these circum- stances prevail, would it be better to hand over the market to a monopoly provider, even an unregulated one? 12. In a simple model of the competitive provision of insurance, explain why there cannot be a pooling equilibrium. How is the candidate separating equilibrium constructed, and what are its features? Under what circumstances does an equilibrium fail to exist? 13. Consider a model of competitive provision of insurance, where each of the risk-neutral companies can oﬀer insurance at a ﬁxed price p per unit, and then consumers can choose their level of cover subject to not over-insuring. (Thus, if a consumer would require a reimbursement of q in the event of a loss, then she must pay a premium of pq to her chosen insurer.) What market outcomes are possible when the consumers are privately informed of their own probability of incurring a loss? 14. Mozart moved from Salzburg to Vienna in 1781, hoping for a position at the Habsburg court. Instead of applying for a position, he waited for the emperor to call him, because “if one makes any move oneself, one receives less pay.” Discuss this situation of asymmetric information, with particular reference to the notions of signalling and/or screening equilibria. 8","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
