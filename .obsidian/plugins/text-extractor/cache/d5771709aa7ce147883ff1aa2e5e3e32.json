Personal costs of executive turnovers. Working paper available at SSRN 2926751. Questions 1. Chalk Inc. mines for chalk. Its CEO, Mr. I. Putt, is the only agent capable of managing Chalk. In this problem, we will consider the effect on luck on Putt’s compensation under the assumptions of the simple P/A model developed in class. As in the simple model, we assume that the board of Chalk sets compensation with the aim of maximizing the payoff of shareholders and that Putt has no ability to influence or suborn the board. Suppose that the value of Chalk at the end of the period equals either vH = 5 or vL = 1. The actual value of Chalk will depend on the effort exerted by Putt. Putt really enjoys taking off work at 2PM to hit the local golf course. The cost to Putt of missing out on afternoon golfing is c = 1. If Putt exerts high effort, H, (i.e., works from 9–5) the probability of vH equals 5/8. If Put exits low effort, L, (i.e., exits the office at 2PM to golf), the probability of vH equals 1/4. a. First suppose that, due to a weak economy, there is no demand for Putt’s labour outside Chalk; so Putt’s reservation wage is w = 0. Using the simple P/A model developed in class, find a shareholder-value maximizing compensation package for Putt; determine Putt’s optimal level of effort under this plan; and determine the payoff to the shareholders of Chalk. b. Now suppose that Chalk has some good luck. The demand for chalk soars because a preliminary medical research report suggest that eating chalk cures a common viral disease. This news doubles Chalk’s value. So now vH = 10 and vL = 2. Assuming that, except for this change, all the other parameters in part (1a) remain unchanged, find a shareholder-value maximizing compensation package for Putt; determine Putt’s optimal level of effort under this plan; and determine the payoff to the shareholders of Chalk. Explain briefly how Chalk’s good luck affects the compensation offered to Putt and Putt’s welfare. c. Now return to the part (1a) assumptions but suppose that the macro economic climate has improved. Because of this good economic news, Chalk is now able to secure alternative employment (which does not require working past 2PM) with other firms. Alternative employment pays w = 1. Assuming that, except for this change, all the other parameters in part (1a) remain unchanged, find a shareholder-value maximizing compensation package for Putt; determine Putt’s optimal level of effort under this plan; and determine the payoff to the shareholders of Chalk. Explain briefly how this fortuitous improvement in the economic climate affects the compensation offered to Putt and Putt’s welfare. 2. The PAM model discussed in class is a neoclassical model. Thus, PAM equilibria, which provide very high compensation to the highest ability managers, result from firm-value maximizing governance and are Pareto efficient. As in any neo-classical model, the PAM model assumes that agents’ expectation are rational and forward looking. However discussed in your week 4 lecture, in reality, economic agents sometimes use behavioural rules to form expectations, e.g., extrapolative expectations. Behavioural biases in expectations’ formation might affect firms’ estimates of the CEO ability in the same fashion as behavioural biases affect shareholders’ expectations of future stock prices. Trace out the implications of behavioural biases in expectation formation for CEO compensation in labour market matching frameworks like PAM. 3. The classical Berle and Means view of ownership in the modern corporation is that firms are owned by large number of shareholders, who, perhaps for reasons related to portfolio diversification, own only tiny fractions of the stock of any one firm. Because of free rider problems, such shareholders will not check managerial opportunism. Checking opportunism requires markets for corporate control, activist funds, or private (typically family) blockholders. This perspective underlies much of the agency theory analysis in corporate finance. However, currently, the ownership in many firms is dominated by institutional common owners. How might institutional common ownership affect the classical shareholder/manager agency problem? What new agency problems might be introduced by institutional common ownership?
