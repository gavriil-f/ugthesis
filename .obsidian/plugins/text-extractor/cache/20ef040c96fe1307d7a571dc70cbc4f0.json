Can one know something without knowing how one knows it? 2. EITHER What is the point, if any, of scepticism? OR ‘Scepticism is a corollary of realism.’ Discuss 3. A subject, taking one hand from a bucket of icy water and the other from a bucket of warm water, places them simultaneously into a bucket of lukewarm water. She reports that the water feels both warm and cool. What does this show? 4. ‘If S knows that p, then S knows that p is possible. Because it is not possible to know any modal truth aposteriori, if we know anythmg at all then we have apriori knowledge.’ Discuss. 5. We accept much of what we know on the basis of the testimony of others. What does this indicate regarding the role of justification in epistemology? 6. ‘Attempts to analyse knowledge inevitably lead to a dead end.’ Discuss. 7. Are facts true propositions? 8. ‘The sentence, “Unicorns do not exist”, is true only if it is about unicorns. So, it is true only if it is false.’ Discuss. 9. How can we tell the difference between a good inductive argument and a bad one? 10. Could one know what redness is without experiencing it at least once? 11. Does the fact that we can always imagine any one event without another mean that we can never know necessary connexions between events? 12. Are all properties in space and time? 13. ”Two things are the same only if they have all their properties in common. Whenever anything changes, it loses or gains a property. So, nothing persists through change.” Assess this argument. 14. Do we know our own minds better than we know anything else? 15. ”Suppose you have a penny in each of your pockets. Each has exactly the same quality, namely, being apenny. So, one and the same quality is in each of your pockets. Since no material object can be in more than one place, the quality, being apenny, is not a material object.” Assess this argument. 0102 -2- 16. Were you ever a foetus? 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. Assuming that every truth has a truth maker, what might be the truth maker for ‘It is possible that the Prime Minister will lose the next election’? Is a false memory a memory? ‘Everything that exists either is a substance or depends upon a substance for its existence.’ Discuss. ‘Material objects are neither more nor less than bundles of tropes.’ Discuss. Could one perceive an atemporal being? Does the fact that the past is fixed mean that time-travel is impossible? PART B: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE Is every scientific theory merely a model? Why do some exceptionless generalizations qualify as laws ofnature while others do not? What is truth-likeness as applied to scientific theories? Is it the best standard of appraisal for progress in science? What is constructive empiricism? Does it represent any real advance over positivist philosophy of science? 27. Is Kuhn right to say that, when choosing between competing paradigms, whether political or scientific, ‘there is no standard higher than the assent of the relevant community’? 28. What role, if any, should parsimony play in the adjudication of competing theories? 29. ‘A theory T, reduces to a more fundamental theory T, if and only if: (i) all of the laws of T, are derivable fiom the laws of T, , and (ii) there are also appropriate bi-conditional bridge principles connecting the predicates of T, with the correlative predicates in T,.’ Discuss. - END OF PAPER - LAST PAGE 0102 -3-","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
