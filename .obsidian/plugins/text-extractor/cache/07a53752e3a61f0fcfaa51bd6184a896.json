{"path":"Attachments/HT24 Philosophy of mind reading list.docx","text":"104: Philosophy of Mind Dr Gail Leckie: Jesus V.10 and gail.leckie@jesus.ox.ac.uk Starred readings are compulsory, others optional. I need at least 8 pieces of written work, although I would accept 6 full essays and 2 timed essays or plans. I’ll give you a take home collection to do by start of week 10 so you can have it marked in time for revision. Please submit essays by email 24 hours before your tutorial. Let me know if there’s any problem with as much warning as you can. Oxford resources Oxam for past papers and canvas for exam reports. Lectures: Davies MT23 (ppts of core lecture) and Martin TT23 (video of a rather particular slant on a specific part of the paper) Textbooks I usually only list Kim in the lists but it’s useful to read chapters from other textbooks as revision or if you need another explanation of a topic or argument. Kim Philosophy of Mind Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson Philosophy of Mind and Cognition 2006 Heil, J. Philosophy of mind: a contemporary introduction Crane, Tim (2001) Elements of Mind: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind (OUP), Lowe, E. J. (2000) An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind (CUP) Anthologies Anthologies collect together the main key papers by topic with some introductory comments. These are useful ways to get hold of papers if you can’t find them online on solo for some reason. I abbreviate them to “Block”, “Chalmers” etc in the lists.

Background Type identity Functionalism Modal arguments Epistemological arguments Mental causation Perception and the argument from illusion Self-knowledge Higher order theories of consciousness The explanatory gap Theories of conceptual content I’m open to requests for topics in weeks 6-8 (eg eliminative materialism, anomalous monism, internalism and externalism about content) Week 0: Background *Look at the handouts from the first four lectures of Will Davies’ MT22 *Kim Philosophy of Mind 3rd ed (chptrs 1-6) You can consult other textbooks if you want more. Make sure you can briefly state the main claims of Cartesian dualism and behaviourism and the main problems and advantages of each. You will need this to understand the background against which theories like type identity theory and functionalism were developed and the problems they aim to address.

Do the ‘disparate commitments of mental and physical language’ rule out the existence of any lawlike connections between mental and physical predicates? Are mental events identical to physical events? Is there room for a plausible non-reductive account of the relation between the mental and the physical? ‘Davidson may show that the absence of psychophysical laws is compatible with the intuition that mental events are causes and effects. But he does not show that it is compatible with the intuition that mental properties are causally relevant.’ Discuss.
