{"path":"Attachments/HT24 K&R tutorials reading list.docx","text":"Knowledge & Reality Housekeeping: Tutorials are Wednesday p.m., meeting in Room V.10. There’s a collection start of next term: 3 hrs, 3 questions. Do attend most of the lectures for epistemology and metaphysics. This is much more important for finals because the syllabus is broad and it is impossible to cover enough in tutorials alone. Let me know if you need advice on which weeks to prioritize for the lectures. My email is gail.leckie@jesus.ox.ac.uk. If you want any pointers or have any questions or concerns during the time you are reading and writing or you feel very stuck, feel free to email me and I will try to respond during 1 working day. I’m usually physically in Jesus Wed-Fri and Mansfield on Mondays. Tutorials: For consistency, I’ll use Jean’s structure for tutorials. “If you are being tutored in a pair, each tutorial one of you will function as the lead tutee, and one of you as the respondent. The lead tutee is the tutee whose essay will function as the focal point for the tutorial. If you are tasked with responding to the lead tutee's essay, this is what's expected of you: First off, you must read your tutorial partner's essay and read it carefully! Try to read it as you would a philosophy paper. You should summarize your partner's essay, to remind us of its content, but make sure that this summary lasts only a couple of minutes or so. Think of the summary as like providing an abstract for your partner's paper. Try to identify the thesis for which they're arguing and if it's unclear, do say so. Most importantly you should engage critically with your partner's essay. Don't just provide a summary of the essay but raise some objections, or at least clarificatory questions.” Submitting work: Please submit essays of 1800-2500 words by email by noon the day before tutorial. I prefer Word editable docs as it’ll be easier to read my comments; pdf is ok though. If you are lead tutee, email the essay to your tute partner at the same time If you are the responding tutee, read the lead’s essay and prepare to kick off the tutorial with a summary and critical engagement. Feedback: I aim to produce the written comments on the lead tutee’s essay for the tutorial so you can refer to them during the session. I’ll produce the written comments on the respondent’s essay the next working day after the tutorial. If you miss the deadline but submit the essay before end of week 9, I can still comment on it, but I don’t promise to do so as rapidly.

Week 1: Knowledge Q: What philosophical account, if any, can be given of what it is for one to know that P? I will assume you’ve already read in first year: Edmund Gettier (1963). Is Justified True Belief Knowledge? Analysis 23(6), 121-123. Jennifer Nagel (2014). Knowledge: A Very Short Introduction, p.58. Oxford: OUP. Alvin Goldman (1967). A Causal Theory of Knowing. The Journal of Philosophy 64(12), 357-372. Lawrence BonJour (1980). Externalist Theories of Empirical Knowledge. Midwest Studies in Philosophy 5(1), 53-74. Reprinted in Bernecker and Dretske. Linda Zagzebski (1994). The Inescapability of Gettier Problems. The Philosophical Quarterly 44(174), 65-73. First year gave you some examples of analyses and theories of knowledge, and the Gettier problem. Our main job this week is to think about the project of analysis and look at an alternative to analysis in Tim Williamson’s work, the account of knowledge as the most general factive mental state. To ensure you have a particular analysis of knowledge (and one that will be of use next week too when we study externalism/internalism about justification), we also study reliabilism. So let’s make sure you feel at ease with the BonJour material and reliablism. If pressed for time, you can read the reliabilism part next week.
