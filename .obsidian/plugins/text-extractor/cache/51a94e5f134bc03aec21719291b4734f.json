Iterated Deletion (a) Use ‘iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies’ to predict the outcome of the following game. Тей Centre Right 1 2 0 Top ' 3 2 0 2 0 1 Bottom 2 0 3 Looking at best responses, Right is never a best response, and is indeed dominated by Left so can be deleted. Having done so, we see that Top dominates Bottom, which can in turn be deleted. Now, Column’s choice is between Left and Centre (against Top), and would select the dominant Centre. So, we predict the outcome to be (Top, Centre).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
