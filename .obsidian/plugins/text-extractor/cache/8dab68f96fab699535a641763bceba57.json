Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. EITHER (a) Can knowledge be analysed as true belief arrived at through the exercise of epistemic virtue? OR (b) ‘Externalism in epistemology ought to be rejected on the grounds that it allows for knowledge to be acquired through the exercise of epistemic vice.’ Discuss. 2. In order to know that p, must one’s evidence rule out all possibilities in which not-p? 3. ‘Sameness of normative standards is a transitive relation between cases; indistinguishability is not.’ Is this a problem for internalism? 4. Is it true that just as perception is acquaintance with the present, memory is acquaintance with the past? 5. Do perceptual experiences always give prima facie justification to believe their contents? 6. Can we rely on deductive reasoning to extend our knowledge? 7. What, if anything, is the difference between the way I come to know about my own mind and the way I come to know about the minds of others? 8. Might whether S knows that p depend on the moral considerations against S’s believing that p? 9. EITHER (a) ‘A wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence.’ (HUME) What truth, if any, is there in this claim? OR (b) ‘If the universe is uniform, inductive inferences are warranted. If the universe is not uniform, no non-deductive inferences are warranted. So we may as well make inductive inferences.’ Discuss. 10. If I call to mind an equilateral triangle, and by manipulating the image in my imagination come to believe that equilateral triangles have three lines of symmetry, is my belief justified a priori or a posteriori? 11. What is the difference between an object and an event? 12. In what sense, if any, do causes necessitate their effects? A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 13. EITHER (a) ‘If there’s a problem of temporary intrinsics, then there’s also a problem of contingent intrinsics.’ Discuss. OR (b) ‘Let O1 and O2 be any two spatially separated objects. Consider the fusion of O1’s temporal part between t1 and t2 and O2’s temporal part between t2 and t3. If there is such an object, it travels faster than the speed of light. So perdurantism ought to be rejected on the grounds that it is incompatible with the laws of physics.’ Is this a fair objection to perdurantism? 14. EITHER (a) ‘If time travel were possible, I could kill my own grandfather. I can’t kill my own grandfather. So time travel is impossible.’ Discuss. OR (b) Can any sense be made of the question of how quickly time passes? What are the consequences of your answer for the metaphysics of time? 15. ‘Either every class of objects has a fusion, or none do; anything else is metaphysically arbitrary.’ Discuss. 16. ‘Since the claim that S1 is psychologically connected with S2 presupposes that S1 and S2 are identical, the psychological-continuity account of personal identity is circular.’ Discuss. 17. What, if anything, makes it true that there are no unicorns? 18. In what sense, if any, is the property of being red more natural than the property of being red-or-green? 19. ‘Race… is something to be rid of.’ (HASLANGER) Is it? 20. Are there impossible worlds?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
