Could one dispense with the concept of knowledge and replace it with justified belief'? 4. Is anything at all knowable a priori'? If o, what are the cntena for a proposition to be a priori knowable'? 5. Can the problems surrounding induction be dealt with by a probabilistic analysis of how we should modify our beliefs'? 6. When I taste certain fine red wines I often take them to smell of cedarwood. My teetotal friend, who has very little sense of smell, claims that I am either deluding myself or postunng. How, if at all, could I convince him otherwise'? 7. How are factual memory and perceptual memory related? 8. Does a true belief correspond to the way things are'? 9. When I see something, what is the relation between that thing and my perception of it? 10 'The evidence for causal interaction must not be confused with its nature' Discuss. 11. Is the problem of other minds an epistemological problem? 12 Can there be time without tense? - 13. 'Individuation is the mind's work'. Is it? 14. Are substances ontologically basic? - 15. Are there possible circumstances in which I carry on existing without being an animal'? 16 Does personal identity matter? 17. Is all necessity verbal? 18. 'If practical recognition of particular things entails practical recognition of general things, why should theoretical recognition, so readily accorded to the former, be given so grudgingly, if at all, to the latter?' (P.F STRAWSON). Discuss. 19. 'Idealism is the only position which can guarantee that our relation to things is direct'. Discuss. 20 Is conceptual analysis an appropriate method for metaphysics? 21 Is there anything that does not exist? 0102 -2- PART B: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 22. Given the vastness and diversity of science, is there any point in asking what its goal is? 23. Is it possible to be a Popperian and still accept that induction plays a significant role within scientific method? 24. Are there any laws of nature which are not ceteris paribus laws? 25. Is the choice between two competing scientific theories simply a matter of prefemng the more probable one? 26. '... normal science ultimately leads only to the recognition of anomalies and to crises. And these are terminated, not by deliberation and interpretation, but by a relatively sudden and unstructured event like the gestalt switch.' (KUT-IN). Do you agree? 27. Is the claim that all observation is theory-laden vacuous, or false, or neither? 28. Does accepting that explanations are of fundamental importance within science lead inexorably towards commitment to scientific realism? 29. What consequences might the underdetermination of theory by data have for our views about the rationality of science? 0102 3 LAST PAGE","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
