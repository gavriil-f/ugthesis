(a) (b) 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 102 Are there any reasons for thinking that some form of foundationalist view ofjustification must be right? Does scepticism presuppose realism? EITHER 'The correct analysis of propositional knowledge should reveal where arguments for radical scepticism go wrong'. Discuss. OR Does contextualism offer an adequate solution to scepticism? How do we perceive change? Could there be some way of proving whether or not sense-data exist? I What is distinctive about a priori knowledge? Should you believe what other people tell you? Is memory a form of perception? What are the similarities and differences between introspection and observation as sources of knowledge? Can an externalist account ofjustification accommodate the fact that one's possession of counter-evidence can make one's belief unjustified? Can one thing turn into another? If not, why not? Can causation ultimately be explained in non-causal terms? Are the relata of the causal relation events, facts, or something else? , Are events concrete particulars? Whether I am identical with the person whose actions I can remember performing depends on whether, as a matter of contingent fact, there exists some other person who can remember performing those actions'. Discuss. Are the only real things those that are purely objective? -2- 17. Can two objects be in the same place at the same time? 18. Is time without change conceivable? 19. Are there unexemplified properties? 20. 21. Is logical necessity the only genuine necessity? 'If anything exists, substance exists'. Discuss. PART B: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 22. Is the success of the natural sciences to be explained? If so, how? 23. Is Popper committed to the view that normal science, in Kuhn's sense, is unscientific? 24. 'In some sense it isprobable that the sun will rise tomorrow.' In what sense? 25. What is the paradox of the ravens, and how is it to be countered? 26. 'I aim to deny all meaning to claims that successive scientific beliefs become more and more probable or better and better approximations to the truth' (KUHN). Discuss. . 27. Who killed logical empiricism? 28. 'Naive realism leads to physics, and physics, if true, shows that naive realism is false. Therefore naive realism, if true, is false; therefore it is false' (RUSSELL). Discuss. 29. A thought experiment surely does not yeld synthetic truth, Does it yield a kind of analytic truth? - END OF PAPER - 102 -3- - - LAST PAGE","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
