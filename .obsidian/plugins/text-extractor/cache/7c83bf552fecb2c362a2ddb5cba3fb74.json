Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. Is scepticism about other minds fundamentally different from skepticism about the external world? 2. Are there unanalysable factive mental states? 3. Does externalism about justification imply that one can have knowledge despite disregarding available evidence? 4. Can one acquire a priori justification by means of testimony? 5. Can one provide a foundationalist justification for foundationalism itself? 6. Is someone who is committing an epistemic injustice epistemically irresponsible? 7. Does the context-sensitivity of the word ‘know’ tell us anything about knowledge itself? 8. Given that light travels at a finite speed, does this imply that we do not visually perceive how things are now but how they were? 9. EITHER (a) Can induction inform us about the past? OR (b) Can it ever be the case that the observation of a non-raven confirms ‘All ravens are black’ to a greater extent than does the observation of a black raven? 10. Is the property of being-F-at-t a relational property? How does this affect the argument from temporary intrinsics? 11. Is it easier to survive fission than to survive fusion? 12. ‘It is not vague how many things exist. Therefore, it cannot be vague whether composition occurs.’ Does this establish that composition cannot be vague? 13. If x prevents y from preventing c from causing e, does this make x a cause of e? 14. Can modality be understood in terms of possible worlds, or does the notion of a possible world presuppose a prior understanding of modality? 15. Are there any fundamental negative facts? 16. Are races social kinds or natural kinds? 17. When x instantiates F, is there a relation of instantiation that is instantiated by x and F? A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 18. Is it possible that an object that is disposed to M when S does not in fact M when S? If so, does this refute counterfactual analyses of dispositions? 19. EITHER (a) Is backward time travel possible if, and only if, time is circular? OR (b) Why does time, but not space, seem to pass?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
