Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. ‘This sceptical doubt…with respect to…the senses, is a malady, which can never be radically cur’d, but must return upon us every moment.’ (HUME) Is it rational, or is it a pathology, constantly to doubt the veracity of one’s senses? 2. EITHER (a) How important is the concept of luck in epistemology? OR (b) Is knowledge prior to belief? 3. Is there any reason to think that ‘knows’ is context sensitive? What significance would it have for epistemology if this were so? 4. Should one try to ensure one’s beliefs rest on certain foundations? 5. ‘In perception one is directly aware of mind-independent objects with size, shape and other perceptible qualities.’ Is there compelling reason to abandon this common sense view? 6. ‘To say that valid predictions are those based on past regularities, without being able to say which regularities, is…pointless.’ (GOODMAN) How does this remark bear on the problem of what justifies us in making inferences from a finite number of instances to a general law subsuming these instances? 7. Are all the propositions knowable by humans either ‘matters of fact’, or ‘relations of ideas’, as Hume maintained? 8. ‘One’s knowledge that other conscious persons exist broadly similar to oneself is based on an inference to the best explanation.’ Do you agree? 9. How readily should one believe what others tell one? 10. What is epistemic injustice? 11. Should we explain causation in terms of counterfactuals, counterfactuals in terms of causation, or neither? 12. ‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? 13. ‘There are at least as many distinct sets of conditions under which objects compose to form another as there are distinct kinds of composite object.’ What can be said in favour of this view? Is it correct? A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 14. What is involved in person A at time t1 being identical with person B at another time, t2? Is this a metaphysical question, a moral question, or something else? 15. ‘Facts are what statements (when true) state.’ (STRAWSON) Would this contention render facts implausibly dependent on what we do, and can, say? 16. ‘It is manifest in our experience that time passes.’ Is this so? What follows for how we should understand the nature of time? 17. EITHER (a) ‘The best explanation for the similarity of various metals is that they all contain free electrons. The best explanation for the similarity of various cubic things is that they all instantiate the universal cubicity.’ Are these claims on a par? Does the latter give us good reason to believe that the universal cubicity exists? OR (b) ‘All categorisation of things into kinds depends upon the interests, purposes, and technological ability of those doing the categorising. So there is at best only a difference of degree between social kinds and natural kinds.’ What, if anything, is correct about this claim? What significance does your answer have for the debate over the reality of race? 18. Can there be spatial points which bear no spatial relations to some other spatial points? 19. ‘If possible worlds are needed to explain modality, it is better not to explain modality.’ Do you agree? 20. What is the distinction, or alleged distinction, between primary and secondary qualities? Are there any good reasons to conclude that secondary qualities do not exist?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
