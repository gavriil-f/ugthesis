Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 6 / 22 Non-Negativity Constraint Univariate function f with non-negativity constraint. We find for the maximum x∗ of f : ▶ x∗ is an interior point of the feasible region: x∗ > 0 and f ′(x∗) = 0; or ▶ x∗ is a boundary point of the feasible region: x∗ = 0 and f ′(x∗) ≤ 0. Summary: f ′(x∗) ≤ 0, x∗ ≥ 0 and x∗ f ′(x∗) = 0 Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 7 / 22 Non-Negativity Constraint For the case of a multivariate function f (x) with non-negativity constraints xj ≥ 0, we obtain such a condition for each of the variables: fxj (x∗) ≤ 0, x∗ j ≥ 0 and x∗ j fxj (x∗) = 0 Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 8 / 22 Slack Variables Maximize f (x1, . . . , xn) subject to g1(x1, . . . , xn) + s1 = c1 ... gk(x1, . . . , xn) + sk = ck x1, . . . , xn ≥ 0 s1, . . . , sk ≥ 0 (new non-negativity constraint) Lagrange function: ˜L(x, s, λ) = f (x1, . . . , xn) + k ∑ i=1 λi(ci − gi(x1, . . . , xn) − si) Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 9 / 22 Slack Variables ˜L(x, s, λ) = f (x1, . . . , xn) + k ∑ i=1 λi(ci − gi(x1, . . . , xn) − si) Apply non-negativity conditions: ∂ ˜L ∂xj ≤ 0, xj ≥ 0 and xj ∂ ˜L ∂xj = 0 ∂ ˜L ∂si ≤ 0, si ≥ 0 and si ∂ ˜L ∂si = 0 ∂ ˜L ∂λi = 0 (no non-negativity constraint) Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 10 / 22 Elimination of Slack Variables Because of ∂ ˜L ∂si = −λi the second line is equivalent to λi ≥ 0, si ≥ 0 and λisi = 0 Equations ∂ ˜L ∂λi = ci − gi(x) − si = 0 imply si = ci − gi(x) and consequently the second line is equivalent to λi ≥ 0, ci − gi(x) ≥ 0 and λi(ci − gi(x)) = 0 . Therefore there is no need of slack variables any more. Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 11 / 22 Elimination of Slack Variables So we replace ˜L by Lagrange function L(x, λ) = f (x1, . . . , xn) + k ∑ i=1 λi(ci − gi(x1, . . . , xn)) Observe that ∂L ∂xj = ∂ ˜L ∂xj and ∂L ∂λi = ci − gi(x) So the second line of the condition for a maximum now reads λi ≥ 0, ∂L ∂λi ≥ 0 and λi ∂L ∂λi = 0 Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 12 / 22 Kuhn-Tucker Conditions L(x, λ) = f (x1, . . . , xn) + k ∑ i=1 λi(ci − gi(x1, . . . , xn)) The Kuhn-Tucker conditions for a (global) maximum are: ∂L ∂xj ≤ 0, xj ≥ 0 and xj ∂L ∂xj = 0 ∂L ∂λi ≥ 0, λi ≥ 0 and λi ∂L ∂λi = 0 Notice that these Kuhn-Tucker conditions are not sufficient. (Analogous to critical points.) Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 13 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Conditions Find the maximum of f (x, y) = −(x − 5)2 − (y − 5)2 subject to x2 + y ≤ 9, x, y ≥ 0 Lagrange function: L(x, y; λ) = −(x − 5)2 − (y − 5)2 + λ(9 − x2 − y) Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 14 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Conditions Lagrange function: L(x, y; λ) = −(x − 5)2 − (y − 5)2 + λ(9 − x2 − y) Kuhn-Tucker Conditions: (A) Lx = −2(x − 5) − 2λx ≤ 0 (B) Ly = −2(y − 5) − λ ≤ 0 (C) Lλ = 9 − x2 − y ≥ 0 (N) x, y, λ ≥ 0 (I) x Lx = −x(2(x − 5) + 2λx) = 0 (I I) y Ly = −y(2(y − 5) + λ) = 0 (I I I) λ Lλ = λ(9 − x2 − y) = 0 Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 15 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Conditions Express equations (I)–(I I I) as (I) x = 0 or 2(x − 5) + 2λx = 0 (I I) y = 0 or 2(y − 5) + λ = 0 (I I I) λ = 0 or 9 − x2 − y = 0 We have to compute all 8 combinations and check whether the resulting solutions satisfy inequalities (A), (B), (C), and (N). ▶ If λ = 0 (I I I, left), then by (I) and (I I) there exist four solutions for (x, y; λ): (0, 0; 0), (0, 5; 0), (5, 0; 0), and (5, 5; 0). However, none of these points satisfies all inequalities (A), (B), (C). Hence λ ̸= 0. Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 16 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Conditions If λ ̸= 0, then (I I I, right) implies y = 9 − x2. ▶ If λ ̸= 0 and x = 0, then y = 9 and because of (I I, right), λ = −8. A contradiction to (N). ▶ If λ ̸= 0 and y = 0, then x = 3 and because of (I, right), λ = 2 3 . A contradiction to (B). ▶ Consequently all three variables must be non-zero. Thus y = 9 − x2 and λ = −2(y − 5) = −2(4 − x2). Substituted in (I) yields 2(x − 5) − 4(4 − x2)x = 0 and x = √11+1 2 ≈ 2.158 y = 12−√11 2 ≈ 4.342 λ = √11 − 2 ≈ 1.317 The Kuhn-Tucker conditions are thus satisfied only in point (x, y; λ) = ( √11+1 2 , 12−√11 2 ; √11 − 2) . Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 17 / 22 Kuhn-Tucker Conditions Unfortunately the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are not necessary! That is, there exist optimization problems where the maximum does not satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. maximum Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 18 / 22 Kuhn-Tucker Theorem We need a tool to determine whether a point is a (global) maximum. The Kuhn-Tucker theorem provides a sufficient condition: (1) Objective function f (x) is differentiable and concave. (2) All functions gi(x) from the constraints are differentiable and convex. (3) Point x∗ satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Then x∗ is a global maximum of f subject to constraints gi ≤ ci. The maximum is unique, if function f is strictly concave. Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 19 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Theorem Find the maximum of f (x, y) = −(x − 5)2 − (y − 5)2 subject to x2 + y ≤ 9, x, y ≥ 0 The respective Hessian matrices of f (x, y) and g(x, y) = x2 + y are H f = (−2 0 0 −2 ) and Hg = (2 0 0 0 ) (1) f is strictly concave. (2) g is convex. Josef Leydold – Foundations of Mathematics – WS 2024/25 16 – Kuhn Tucker Conditions – 20 / 22 Example – Kuhn-Tucker Theorem H f = (−2 0 0 −2 ) and Hg = (2 0 0 0 ) (1) f is strictly concave. (2) g is convex. (3) Point (x, y; λ) = ( √11+1 2 , 12−√11 2 ; √11 − 2) satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Thus by the Kuhn-Tucker theorem, x∗ = ( √11+1 2 , 12−√11 2 ) is the maximum we sought for.
