{"path":"Attachments/Philosophy FHS marking conventions 2023-24.pdf","text":"Faculty of Philosophy: marking conventions for Finals These marking conventions will be used by Philosophy examiners and assessors in marking work in philosophy for the Honour Schools. They apply for use in the academic year 2023-24 and will be reviewed each subsequent year. Agreement of marks Following the agreement of the Humanities Education Panel in Michaelmas Term 2019, the Faculty now adopts the following protocol for agreement of marks:  If markers are agreed on the class of a script, and the difference between them is 4 marks or less, then averaging of the two marks to produce a final mark is permissible.  If markers disagree on the class of a script, or differ by 5 or more marks within a class, then full discussion to resolve marks must take place. Criteria for examination essay work The following conventions will be used for marking essay work in timed written examinations. The conventions use positive criteria (marked by “+”) and negative criteria (marked by “-”) in order to assign marks. Written work is taken to meet the criteria set out below if for the most part it satisfies the relevant descriptions. These descriptions are to be interpreted in light of what would be expected at the undergraduate level rather than in absolute terms. First class: 100 to 70 Upper: 84+ Exceptional answer displaying originality, outstanding analytical and argumentative skills, superior command of the facts and arguments relevant to the question, excellent organisation, and lucid and precise expression. Middle: 81, 78 Excellent answer offering high-level analysis, independent and rigorous argument, skilled handling of the facts and arguments relevant to the question, transparent organisation, and lucid and precise expression. Lower: 75, 72 Strong answer displaying a high standard of analysis and argument, a thorough command of the facts and/or arguments relevant to the question, transparent organisation and clear language. Upper second (2.1): 69 to 60 Upper: 69 to 65 + Effective analysis and argumentation, thorough command of evidence, clarity of expression, transparent organisation of material. - Occasional imprecision in argumentation or expression; or lack of depth; or minor omissions; or lapses in focus. Lower: 60-64 + Well-structured answer offering a generally accurate analysis of central arguments and themes, and a well-reasoned conclusion. - Occasional lapses in argumentation; writing may be somewhat pedestrian or unclear or imprecise; some omissions or infelicity in organisation of material. Lower second (2.2): 59 to 50 Upper: 59 to 55 + Adequate, if somewhat basic, analysis and understanding of key concepts and arguments. - Significantly lacking in scope, depth or precision; pat or pedestrian representation of thoughts and arguments; important inaccuracies or omissions; some lapses in argumentation. Lower: 50-54 + Answer showing a basic grasp of relevant material and arguments, and a fair attempt to arrive at a reasoned conclusion. - Serious inaccuracies or omissions; significant lapses in argumentation (e.g. nonsequiturs, misuse of concepts or evidence); failure to digest material; minor irrelevance. Third: 49 to 40 Upper: 49 to 45 + Limited answer to the question; constructs a rudimentary argument; some evidence of relevant study. - Superficial or incomplete treatment; some gaps or mistakes in understanding of key concepts and arguments; poor focus and organisation; some irrelevance. Lower: 40-44 + Significant elements of a basic and relevant answer. - Muddled argumentation, very superficial discussion with poor focus, significant misunderstanding of key concepts and arguments; considerable irrelevance; seriously incomplete answer. Pass: 39 to 30 + Limited attempt to address question showing a rudimentary grasp of some relevant information. - Very incomplete, brief, or poorly organised answer; fundamental misunderstanding of key arguments or ideas; large portions of discussion irrelevant or tangential. Fail: 0 to 29 Upper: 15-29 + Some slight evidence of a proper attempt to answer question; glimpse of relevant material. - Extremely limited and inadequate answer, for instance in note form; discussion mostly irrelevant. Lower 0-14: - Completely or almost completely irrelevant or ignorant answer. Nothing or almost nothing written. The class boundaries and class descriptors for all classes remain the same across all Honour Schools involving Philosophy. Criteria for work in extended essays or theses The following conventions will be used for marking submitted written work, such as extended essays or theses. The conventions use positive criteria (marked by “+”) and negative criteria (marked by “-”) in order to assign marks. First class: 100 to 70 Upper: 84+ Exceptional work displaying originality, outstanding analytical and argumentative skills, superior command of a wide range of facts and arguments relevant to the question, excellent organisation and presentation, lucid and precise expression. Middle: 81, 78 Excellent work offering high-level analysis, independent and rigorous argument, critical understanding of a wide range of relevant material, transparent organisation and presentation, lucid and precise expression. Lower: 75, 72 Strong work displaying a high standard of analysis and argument, critical insight, and a thorough command of the relevant material; transparent organisation and presentation; clear and precise expression. Upper second (2.1): 69 to 60 Upper: 69 to 65 + Effective analysis and argumentation, demonstrating thorough command of relevant material; transparent organisation and presentation of material; clarity of expression. - Occasional imprecision in argumentation or expression; or lack of depth; or minor omissions; or lapses in focus. Lower: 60-64 + Clearly structured and generally coherent discussion, offering a mostly accurate analysis of central arguments and themes, and a justified conclusion. - Occasional lapses in argumentation; writing may be somewhat pedestrian or showing unclarity or imprecision of expression; some omissions or infelicity in organisation of material and/or presentation (e.g. missing or incomplete references, misquotations or misattributions). Lower second (2.2): 59 to 50 Upper: 59 to 55 + Adequate, if somewhat basic, analysis and understanding of key concepts and arguments; generally cogent and well-structured treatment of topic. - Lacking in scope, depth or precision; pat or pedestrian representation of thoughts and arguments; important inaccuracies or omissions; some lapses in argumentation and/or presentation. Lower: 50-54 + Discussion showing a reasonable grasp of basic material and arguments, and a fair attempt to arrive at a reasoned conclusion. - Significant inaccuracies or omissions; major lapses in argumentation (e.g. nonsequiturs, misuse of concepts or evidence affecting overall conclusions); failure to digest material; minor irrelevance; sloppy presentation. Third: 49 to 40 Upper: 49 to 45 + Limited treatment of topic showing some familiarity with relevant material and arguments; recognisable structure. - Superficial or incomplete treatment; gaps or mistakes in understanding of key concepts and arguments; poor focus and organisation; some irrelevance; poor presentation. Lower: 40-44 + Significant elements of a basic and relevant answer showing some structure. - Muddled argumentation, very superficial discussion with poor focus, significant misunderstanding of key concepts and arguments; considerable irrelevance; incomplete answer; substandard presentation. Pass: 39 to 30 + Limited attempt to address question showing a basic grasp of some relevant material. - Seriously incomplete answer; fundamental misunderstanding of key arguments or ideas; significant portions of discussion irrelevant or tangential; basic failures of organisation and presentation. Fail: 0 to 29 Upper: 15-29 + Very limited attempt to answer question; some use of relevant material. - Wholly inadequate answer, discussion largely irrelevant; unacceptably poor organisation and/or presentation. Lower 0-14: - Completely or almost completely irrelevant or ignorant answer. A very short piece of work, providing no or negligible evidence of study. The class boundaries and class descriptors for all classes remain the same across all Honour Schools involving Philosophy. Criteria for translation work (in ancient philosophy papers) These criteria are using for marking translation elements of those ancient philosophy papers where students render a passage into English. Resourceful use of English will be rewarded, as will accuracy in detail, effectiveness, and faithfulness in conveying the sense of the original; incorrect and unduly clumsy English will be penalised. Candidates are liable to be penalised severely for errors in detail as well as for errors which suggest ignorance of the context (if the passage has one) and essential drift of the passage. First class: 85 to 70 (NB: marks above 85 are not awarded for translation work) Upper: 80-85: Outstanding and memorable, showing all first class qualities to a remarkable degree. Sense and register of the passage admirably handled. The odd failing may be allowed. Lower: 70-79: A candidate has got the passage mostly right, with only minor errors or very few errors; deals intelligently with difficulties; handles the stylistic variations of the passage well. Upper second (2.1): 69 to 60 A candidate has grasped the general sense and drift of the passage well, though with a number of errors; appears to have a good grasp of the context of the passage, if it has one. Lower second (2.2): 59 to 50 A candidate has essentially grasped the drift of the passage (and of the context, if there is one), but has made more, or more serious, errors than in a II.1 script. Third: 49 to 40 A candidate shows only a shaky grasp of what is happening in the passage and has made a number of grave mistakes, but has shown some knowledge and understanding of the language and of the context (where applicable) of the passage. Pass: 39 to 30 Very poor quality work, showing little knowledge of the language or of the context and content of the passage, but enough to justify the award of a pass mark. Fail: 0 to 29 20-29: Displays seriously deficient knowledge of the ancient language, and little or no knowledge or understanding of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, and/or familiarity with set texts. Translations into English entirely discontinuous and/or nonsensical, displaying little or no grasp either of the language or of the meaning of the passage(s), and with little or no sensible attempt at guesswork. 10-19: Work which suffers from the above shortcomings to a more extreme degree. 5-9: A seriously incomplete script, comprising no more than a few responses and/or making no real effort to make sense of the passage. 1-4: A blank script or a response which entirely fails to make sense of the passage. Criteria for commentary work These criteria apply for questions where candidates undertake commentary on a passage. First class: 100 to 70 Upper: 80 to 100: + A commentary displaying in-depth knowledge of the passage, excellent analysis and criticism of the argument(s), distinction(s), or concept(s) found in the passage, a lucid and concise account of the relation of the passage to the wider context, or/and the whole work, or/and the author’s general thought, or/and some problem in modern philosophy. Lower: 79 to 70 + A commentary showing a good understanding of the immediate and wider context of the passage, lucid and concise analysis of the ideas and/or arguments involved, and clear and precise language. Upper second (2.1): 69 to 60 Upper: 69 to 65 + A commentary displaying a good understanding of the context and a clear and concise analysis of arguments, distinctions and/or concepts in the passage. - Limited command of some aspects of the passage, or context; minor lapses in the analysis of the argument, occasional unclarity in expression or use of concepts. Lower: 64 to 60 + A generally clear and satisfactory commentary, offering a mostly correct specification of the argumentative context and a reasonable analysis of the argument, distinction(s), or/and concepts of the passage. - Some lapses in argumentation and/or invoking evidence from the passage; some inaccuracy in identification of context; somewhat pedestrian, unclear, or imprecise expression. Lower second (2.2): 59 to 50 + A competent if basic commentary showing familiarity with the passage and its context; mostly clear and relevant analysis of passage; some attempt to offer a critical perspective. - Gives an incomplete account of the context of the passage; significant inaccuracies or gaps in analysing or criticising the argument of the passage; marred by lapses in concision, relevance, and lucidity of expression. Third: 49 to 40 + A commentary that contains evidence of some knowledge of relevant facts and analytical skill. - Generally weak, with confused or little specification of the context, or discussion and criticism of the argument of the passage; some irrelevance; muddled and unclear language. This class does qualify for an Honours degree. Pass: 39 to 30 + Some attempt to specify the argumentative context or/and content of the passage; occasionally relevant material. - Extremely limited and inadequate commentary; comments largely (but not entirely) irrelevant. Fail: 29 to 0 Completely, or almost completely, irrelevant or ignorant commentary; nothing, or almost nothing, written. NB: Candidates should note that one of the commonest reasons for commentaries receiving poor marks is irrelevance.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
