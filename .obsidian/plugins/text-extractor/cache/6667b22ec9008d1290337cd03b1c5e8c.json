Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. I. ls there any role for the concept of knowledge which goes beyond that already played by the concept of true belief? 2. Can one hold that no belief is justified independently of other beliefs and still find a justificatory role for experience? 3. EITHER (a) Does an externalist account of justification just change the subject? OR (b) 'Any episode of belief-formation is an instance of countless processes, some reliable and some unreliable.' Does this observation doom reliabilism? 4. Can one know that one has hands while not being in a position to know that one is not a handless brain in a vat? Why might the issue seem important? 5. Whether induction is rational is one question; whether induction is reliable is another. Need anything more be said to resolve the problem of induction? 6. What is the difference between remembering John's eating the apple and seeing John eating the apple? 7. 'It is no harder to know that other people have minds - and to know something of what they think, feel, and so on - than it is to know that one has a mind oneself.' Discuss. 8. EITHER (a) Why not simply suppose that all and only the things knowable a priori are analytic truths? OR (b) ls any justification purely a posteriori? 9. 'Insofar as observations could undermine our entitlement to trust testimony, so also testimonies could undennine our entitlement to trust particular observations.' Is this true? Does it follow that testimony and observation are equally basic as sources of knowledge? I 0. What is the relationship between outright belief and degrees of belief? 11. Is the phenomenon of change of properties over time any more puzzling than the variation of temperature along the length ofan iron bar? 12. 'Spiders and insects share many impottant properties; therefore there are properties.' Is that a good argument? 0102 2 13. EITHER (a) 'It is possible for there to be a blue swan; therefore there is a blue swan in some possible world; therefore there is a blue swan.' Discuss. OR (b) 'The world is not a possible world.' Ts this true according to the best account of modality? 14. Suppose there is only ever one ball-throwing. Can throwing the ball cause the window to break? 15. Suppose that one fonus a bronze statue by pouring molten copper and molten tin into a mould, and later destroys the statue by dissolving it in acid. Is the statue distinct from the lump of bronze that always coincides with it? 16. 'Since there can be merely apparent memories, no account of personal identity can appeal to memories without begging the question.' Does this follow? 17. Is the conespondence theory of truth the only account according to which statements are true or false in virtue of how the world objectively is? 18. Is there a good philosophical argument against the thesis that all facts supervene on the facts about the arrangement of local qualities in spacetime? 19. 'The standard of ontological commitment in metaphysics is the same as that in the sciences - one is committed to what one quantifies over in one's best theory. Accordingly, it cannot be correct to castigate metaphysics as unscientific.' Discuss. 20. 'Since intuitions aren't evidence, the methodology of reflective equilibrium is not truth-conducive - it is simply an exercise in refining our prejudices.' Is that so? 0102 3 LAST PAGE 0102 0102 SECOND PUBLIC EXAMINATION Honour School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics Honour School of Literae Humaniores Honour School of Philosophy and Modern Languages Honour School of Philosophy and Theology Honour School of Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology Honour School of Mathematics and Philosophy (Part B) Honour School of Mathematics and Philosophy (Part C) Honour School of Physics and Philosophy (Part B) Honour School of Mathematics (Part B) KNOWLEDGE AND REALITY TRINITY TERM 2013 Wednesday 29 May 2013, 9.30am -12.30pm This paper contains twenty questions.
