Answers need not be long. But they should be incisive and to the point. 1. Homemade leverage: under the Modigliani-Miller assumptions, recall the example discussed in the lecture: Income Low Medium High Unlevered Firm: Shares outstanding 400 400 400 Earnings 400 1,200 2,000 Assets 8,000 8,000 8,000 Equity 8,000 8,000 8,000 Debt 0 0 0 Interest 0 0 0 ROE 0.05 0.15 0.25 EPS 1 3 5 Unlevered Firm: Shares outstanding 200 200 200 Earnings Before Interest 400 1,200 2,000 Assets 8,000 8,000 8,000 Equity 4,000 4,000 4,000 Debt 4,000 4,000 4,000 Interest 400 400 400 Earnings 0 800 1,600 ROE 0 0.2 0.4 EPS 0 4 8 The interest rate on both personal and corporate loans is the same, 10%. Analyse and compare the following strategies: • Strategy A: Buy 100 shares of levered equity, at price $20 a share. • Strategy B: Borrow $2,000 from a bank. Use the loan plus your own investment of $2,000 to purchase 200 shares of the current unlevered equity at $20 per share. Discuss a key assumption of MM that leads to your results. Now suppose that the value of the levered firm is higher than the value of the unlevered firm. What would be a rational investment strategy? 2. Frank and Goyal (2003) assert that (i) the pecking order theory of Myers and Majluf (1984) is founded on asymmetric information and (ii) the asymmetry of information between insiders and outsiders is greater for small firms. They document that the pecking order theory, in fact, fits the actual financing behaviour of large firms better than the financing behaviour of smaller firms. They argue, based on (i) and (ii), that this better fit for large firms is evidence against pecking order theory. What do you think about this argument? Are there any properties of the pecking order theory that might lead one to believe that the pecking order theory fits large firms better than small firms? 3. In Myers (1977), the authors argue that if debt matures before the investment decision is made, debt will have no effect on whether the investment is made or on the value of the firm. Would this still be the case if default generated financial distress costs? Why? Now consider Myers (1977) when debt matures after the investment option expires. Suppose that I < V (s) < I + P. Myers predicts that in this case, the investment will not be undertaken and the payoff to shareholder and the debt holders will equal 0. Do you think that the creditor and the debtor might be able to negotiate their way out of this very bad outcome? Are there any practical difficulties that might prevent such a work around?
