Gavriil Fakih Trinity 2024 Internalism at its most broad holds that something can only confer justification of an agent’s belief if it falls ‘within their perspective of the world’. Depending on how this notion of perspective is understand, there are a variety of senses of ‘internal’ that could in theory render correct the claim that justification is internal. However, in assessing a variety of motivations for holding the internalist position, I argue that none of these senses will succeed. As such, I believe internalism fails to provide a plausible account of epistemic justification. 1\tInternalisms The claim that justification is internal can be broadly understood as the claim it ‘is only what is within an agent’s perspective [that] can determine the justification of her beliefs.’ (Vahid 2011, p. 145) Externalism can be characterised simply as the denial of this claim. Depending on how we understand the notion of ‘being within an agent’s perspective’, there are a variety of senses of ‘internal’ that could in theory render correct the claim that justification is indeed internal. Mentalism holds that one’s justification for believing p supervenes on one’s mental states. As such, any agent with a set of mental states S cannot be justified in holding a belief while another agent with an identical set of mental states is not, or vice versa. Access internalism can be characterised as the claim that to be justified an agent is required to be actually aware of the conditions that constitute their justification. This is a strong form of access internalism. A weaker form may loosen the accessibility condition; thus the agent needs only to be able to access justifiers of her belief. There are other senses of internal proposed also. 2\tPossible motivations for internalism Perhaps the simplest motivation for accepting an internalism of some variety is the intuition that epistemic justification requires having good reasons for one’s beliefs. After all, we consider it irrational to not be able to give a good reason for holding a given belief. However, this argument is open firstly to the objection that you simply cannot give reasons for all your beliefs. As such, it does not deny the weak externalist claim that allows for at least some justifying factors of a belief to be external to an agent’s cognitive perspective. In supporting this objection, it is very arguable that there exists a certain species of basic beliefs for which you cannot give justification. Such a scenario may prima facie seem hard to accept but consider the case if it were not so. In order to be justified in believing that p, I must be justified in believing that my evidence e adequately supports p. In turn, the justification of this latter, higher-order, belief would in turn require further beliefs. Thus, if we do not allow for some foundational beliefs, we engender an infinite vicious regress unless we drop this higher-order requirement. There are some internalist accommodations proposed to this problem. À la Fumerton, we could claim that there are certain beliefs that I am justified in holding simply in virtue of being directly acquainted with them. The upshot of this strategy is that this direct acquaintance is a mental act and requires no further justification. I do not need provide justification for some fact p if I am directly aquatinted with it, thus the regress stops at some level or another. Yet this seems to tread to close to simply dressing up externalism in internalist language. If my direct acquaintance with some fact p involves no claim or assertion about its validity or character, and I am not required to be aware of its nature then it what way is this an internalist constraint? Surely this seems more in line with the externalist’s theory more than anything. An alternative path to motivating internalism comes from emphasising the supposedly normative nature of epistemology. The premise of such an argument may rest on the concept of justification seemingly connoting some deontological concept of duty or neglect, praise, or blame. We thus have some epistemic or intellectual requirement, by virtue of being intellectual or rational beings, to accept beliefs that are true or likely to be true and reject beliefs that are false or likely to be false. This is fundamentally an internal process that is akin to the normative process implicit in ethical decision-making. Yet this may not convince us. First of all, the process seems too deliberative. It seemingly requires us to be in full control of our epistemic resources and cognitive faculties, an ideal which we likely do not fulfil even at the best of times. As such, it seems farfetched that we are justification is hinged on such a process. Secondly, and relatedly, it presumes our beliefs are analogous to actions and entirely within our control. Setting aside the contentious nature of the free will debate when it comes to action, it would be strange if we would have to approach all our beliefs with some deontological duty-bound decision-making process and not be justified in relying on our attuned intuitions at times. Consider Srinivasan’s Classist College case, wherein a new working class student intuitively picks up upon the subtle classism at his Oxford college, despite no explicit to support his belief, and in fact seeming evidence to the contrary in the assurances of the college Master (Srinivisan 2020). One last issue to bring up is to say that this deontological idea may be captured by the weaker constraint that we do not have access to defeating reasons. This alone may be enough, and as such the initial claim may be far too strong. Thus the internalist case is weakened. I will note one final potential route to internalism. Consider the case of Norman, a reliable Clairvoyant. He accepts the beliefs his powers emanate without bothering to check if they are true, and he possesses no available evidence to back up the reliability of his powers. Now suppose Norman arrives at the belief that the President of the United States is at this current point in time in New York. The President is in fact in New York, but all other sources of potential evidence point to the fact that he is in Washington DC instead. Would Norman be epistemically justified? Typical externalists, whether they adopt some truth-tracking theory of justification or simple reliabilism, would tell us that he is. But this runs contrary to a prevailing intuition that he is not. Norman’s belief is irresponsible and irrational: he rejects evidence to the contrary and accepts a verdict from a source he has no reason to trust. He thus flouts his epistemic duty, exhibiting no reflection on the sources of his belief, and is thereby unjustified (to the internalist at least). A number of things can be said against this case. Firstly, it would be wise to point out the trouble of relying on our intuition in such a case. We are on ‘weird’ ground so to speak, having to stretch our intuitions to consider the case of a Clairvoyant with powers we cannot fathom and have no personal experience of. Secondly, taken on its own this case does not make the positive case for an internalism of some kind, simply the negative case against externalism. The utility of this case rests on its ability to push us to accepting that we need good reasons for our beliefs, something I have already touched upon. 3\tThe faulty architecture of internalism Perhaps we should expect the aforementioned motivations for accepting internalism to fail given the theory’s faulty architecture. Goldman (1999) lays out the following structure for a general argument for internalism: \t1) A guidance-deontological (GD) conception of justification is posited. \t2) A certain constraint on the determiners of justification is derived from the GD. 3) The accessibility constraint is taken to imply that only internal conditions qualify as legitimate determiners of justification. So, justification must be purely an internal affair. One first interesting point of note in Goldman’s argument is that it makes the case that access internalism seems to imply mentalism. This would then seem to rule out the more plausible of the two internalisms. After all, if remain neutral on an explicit access constraint, then we do not do justice to the intuition that drives internalism: the idea that we need to be able to give good reasons for our beliefs. Another problematic feature of this general argument for internalism is once again the emphasis on a guidance-deontological concept of epistemic justification. As noted, this presumes some unshakeable parallel between actions and beliefs that leaves us open to a number of forceful objections: it is too deliberative, and it presumes we are always in full control of our epistemic resources when accepting justified beliefs. Using this general argument to break down internalism allows us therefore to see that it in some ways relies on a guidance-deontological concept. Further, if internalists are to accept this general argument, it seems they are led inextricably to mentalism, which is less plausible then access internalism. 4\tConclusion Internalism holds in essence that epistemic justification is an internal affair. Prima facie, there are a number of motivations for internalism, namely the intuition that we need good reasons for our beliefs. However, these motivations can be attacked. What we are left with is no good reason to accept internalism. As such, I believe there are no senses of internal which would render correct the claim that justification is internal.
