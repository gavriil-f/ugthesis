At stage 1, player 1 can play either Left (L) ог Right (R). 1Ё she plays L, then, at stage 2, player 2 can play left (¢) resulting in a payoff of 2 to player 1 & 5 to player 2, or he can play centre (c) with payoffs (3,4), or right () with payoffs (4,3); if she plays R, then player 2 can play up (u) with payoffs (6,1), or play down (d) with payoffs (1,6). What are player l’s pure strategies? What are player 2’s? Draw the game tree and determine the subgame perfect equilibrium. Player 1’в pure strategies are L апа В. Player 2’s pure strategies must specify which action to take after each history of play, and he has three choices after L and two after R, so six altogether: # after L апа u after R; ( after L and d after R; c after L and u after R; c after L and d after R; r after L and u after R; r after L and d after R. 1 й L Ng<(m) [ r d (1,6) (2,5) (3,4) (4,3) After L, player 2 15 choosing among (,c,r with payoffs о 5, 4, 3, and so would choose Ç; after R, player 2 is choosing between u,d with payoffs of 1, 6, and so would choose d. So, player 1 is choosing between L with a payoff of 2, and R with a payoff of 1, and would choose to play L. Therefore the subgame perfect equilibrium is (L; ¢ after L, d after R).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
