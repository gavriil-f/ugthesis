In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. Aggregate Demand Consider an economy with two goods, 1 and 2, and two consumers, a and b. The preferences of consumers are represented by the utility functions: ua(xa 1, x a 2) = 2 ln xa 1 + 3 ln xa 2 and ub(xb 1, x b 2) = 2 ln xb 1 + ln xb 2 . Consumer a has an endowment of 20 units of good 1 (and none of good 2), and consumer b has an endowment of 12 units of good 2 (and none of good 1). (a) Taking the relative price ρ = p1/p2 as given, calculate each consumer’s demand for each of the two goods. (b) Construct the excess demand function for each good. (c) Verify that Walras’ Law holds. (d) Find the Walrasian equilibrium relative price and allocation of this economy. 2. Equilibrium with Exchange Consider a pure exchange economy with two consumption goods, 1 and 2, and two consumers, a and b. Consumer a has an endowment of 10 units of good 1 (and none of good 2), and preferences that are represented by the utility function: ua(xa 1, x a 2) = ln xa 1 + ln xa 2 ; consumer b has an endowment of 10 units of good 2 (and none of good 1), and pref- erences that are represented by the utility function: u b(xb 1, x b 2) = ln xb 1 + ln xb 2 . Normalise the price of good 1 to 1, and write p for the price of good 2. (a) Draw this economy in an Edgeworth box, putting good 1 on the x-axis and good 2 on the y-axis. Identify the initial endowment. Sketch in a budget line and some indiﬀerence curves for each consumer. (b) Write down the budget constraints and the consumers’ constrained optimisation problems. (c) Solve the consumers’ problems using Lagrangeans. Evaluate the consumers’ de- mand curves for goods 1 and 2. What does the Lagrange multiplier represent? (d) Write down two market clearing conditions. (e) Hence ﬁnd the Walrasian equilibrium relative price and allocation of this economy. Sketch it in your diagram. 1 3. Initial Endowments and Equilibria Consider a pure exchange economy with two goods, x and y, and two consumers, a and b, that trade the goods. The preferences of consumer a are represented by the utility function ua(xa, ya) = xa + ln ya, and the preferences of consumer b are represented by the utility function: ub(xb, yb) = xb + ln yb. (a) With the price of good x normalised to 1, calculate the Walrasian equilibrium when consumer a has an endowment (4, 0) of (x, y) and consumer b has an en- dowment (0, 4). (b) Now assume that consumer a has an endowment (0, 4) and consumer b has an endowment (4, 0). What is the Walrasian equilibrium in this case? (c) Now assume that consumer a has an endowment (0, 1) and consumer b has an endowment (4, 3). Are there gains from trade? (d) Illustrate your ﬁndings in an Edgeworth box. Comment brieﬂy. 4. 3 × 3 Economy Consider an exchange economy with three sorts of good: apples (A), bananas (B), and cherries (C). There are 20 traders, 10 of type 1, and 5 each of types 2 and 3, whose initial allocation is as follows: type 1 traders each own 10 apples, type 2 traders each own 5 bananas, type 3 traders each own 20 cherries. All traders have the same utility function that depends only on their consumption of apples (xA), bananas (xB), and cherries (xC): u(xA, xB, xC) = x 1 2 Ax 1 4 Bx 1 4 C. Let pA, pB, and pC denote the prices of the three sorts of good, and normalise pC (the price of cherries) to 1. Suppose that all traders can trade freely taking prices as given. (a) Will all types of trader engage in trade? Why? (b) What is the demand for apples, bananas and cherries for each type of trader? (c) Calculate the excess demand for apples and bananas in the economy. Calculate the competitive equilibrium prices. What is the excess demand for cherries in this competitive equilibrium? Why? 2 5. Equilibrium with Production Consider an economy with a single turnip farmer endowed with one unit of time (available for work and leisure) and a ﬁeld. The farmer has preferences represented by the utility function: u(t, l) = ln t + ln(1 − l) , where t is the number of turnips consumed and l is labour supplied. There is only one industry in this economy − turnip production − which requires two inputs, labour and ﬁelds. Turnips are competitively produced with a production function: f (L, F ) = L 1 2 F 1 2 , where L is the total labour used and F is the total number of ﬁelds used. Assume that all three markets in this economy (for turnips, labour, and ﬁelds) are competitive. Normalise the turnip price to 1. Let w be the wage, and r the ﬁeld’s rental price. (a) Argue that the farmer’s budget constraint may be written t ≤ wl + r. (b) Hence ﬁnd the farmer’s optimal demand for turnips and supply of labour in terms of r and w. When is labour supply positive? (c) If the industry employs inputs L and F , what are costs? (d) Using a Lagrangean with multiplier λ, solve the cost-minimisation problem and deduce the factor demand curves for labour and ﬁelds. Interpret λ. (e) Remember that the supply of ﬁelds is 1. Calculate turnip supply in terms of r w . Using three market clearing conditions, ﬁnd the Walrasian equilibrium. 6. Equilibrium with Production and International Trade Consider a small closed economy with two consumption goods, good 1 (meat) and good 2 (berries). There are two types of agent, h and g, and they have the same preferences over consumption, represented by the utility function: u(x1, x2) = ln x1 + ln x2 , but there are twice as many type-h agents as type-g agents. The only factors of production are their labour: when a type-h agent chooses to spend a fraction α of his day producing meat and the rest producing berries then his output is (yh 1 , yh 2 ) = (2α, 2(1 − α)); a type-g agent is more productive – when she chooses to spend a fraction β of her day producing meat and the rest producing berries then her output is (yg 1, yg 2) = (3β, 12(1 − β)). Normalise the price of one unit of berries (good 2) to 1, and let p be the price of one unit of meat (good 1). 3 (a) What would the agents choose for α and β if p < 1? What would the agents choose for α and β if p > 4? Argue that those values of p cannot be part of an equilibrium. Now, assume that 1 < p < 4. (Check later that these inequalities are strict.) (b) Taking p as given, calculate what each agent will produce daily. Imagine that the agents sell their output to the market at prices p and 1, produc- ing ‘income’, and then decide on how much of each good they actually want to consume, resulting in ‘expenditure’. Calculate what each agent will demand. (c) Remembering that there are twice as many type-h agents as type-g agents, ﬁnd the value of p that equates demand and supply in the meat market, and conﬁrm that 1 < p < 4. Check that with this value of p, demand and supply are equated in the market for berries. (d) Show that in this equilibrium, type-h agents each consume 1 unit of meat and 3 units of berries, whereas type-g agents each consume 2 units of meat and 6 units of berries. The hunter-gatherers now have the possibility of opening up their economy to free trade. In world markets, 1 unit of meat can be exchanged for 2 units of berries, and the country would be a price-taker. (e) Using world prices, calculate what each agent would produce daily. By considering whether each type of agent would become better or worse oﬀ, what do you think would be the likely outcome of a referendum on whether or not to open up the economy? 7. Ricardo Consider an economy which is endowed with L units of a single factor of production, labour, and can produce two goods with production functions y1 = a1L1, and y2 = a2L2. Derive the economy’s production possibility frontier. Derive the supply curves for goods 1 and 2 as a function of the goods price ratio, p1/p2. What is the autarky goods price ratio? This country can trade with another with endowment L ∗ and technology y1 = a∗ 1L1, and y2 = a∗ 2L2. For what conﬁguration of parameters a1, a2, a∗ 1, and a∗ 2 does country 1 export good 1? Interpret your result. What is the world supply curve of good 1, and what determines the world equilibrium goods price ratio? 4 8. Trade and Intensity of Factors Country A has two industries, each employing capital and labour to produce output, with constant-returns-to-scale production functions: y1 = K 1/3 1 L 2/3 1 y2 = K 2/3 2 L 1/3 2 Factor and product markets are competitive; the prices of the two products are p1 and p2, and the prices of labour and capital are w and r. (a) By solving the cost minimisation problem for a ﬁrm in industry 1 producing an amount of output y1, show that: • the optimal capital-labour ratio in industry 1 is: K1 L1 = w 2r • and the marginal cost of y1 is: M C1 = ( w 2/3 )2/3 ( r 1/3 )1/3 • and hence similarly: K2 L2 = 2w r , M C2 = ( w 1/3 )1/3 ( r 2/3 )2/3 Which good is more labour intensive? (b) The country has an endowment of 160 units of capital, and 200 units of labour. Use the optimal capital-labour ratios above to determine how much capital and labour will be used in each industry, as functions of the factor price ratio. Il- lustrate the factor market equilibrium in an Edgeworth box for the case when w/r = 1. How would the output of the two industries change if the endowment of labour decreased? (c) Use the conditions that price equals marginal cost in both industries to show that there is a one-to-one relationship between relative factor prices and relative product prices: w r = (p1 p2 )3 . How does the wage change if demand for product 1 increases? Explain this result intuitively. (d) How do your results relate to the Stolper-Samuelson and Rybczynski Theorems? There is a second country, B, identical to A except that it has a smaller endowment of labour. Consumers in the two countries have identical preferences: the relative demand for the two goods, y1 y2 , is a function only of the relative prices, p1 p2 . (e) Initially both countries are both in autarkic (no trade) equilibrium. Suppose that product prices in country A (determined by consumer demand) are equal: p1/p2 = 1. What can you say about relative product prices and relative factor prices in country B? (f) Now suppose that the countries can trade freely with each other. Describe what happens to relative product and factor prices in the two countries. Which goods will be imported and exported by country A? What happens in country A to employment and output in the two industries? 5 Essay-style Questions 1. What is a Walrasian equilibrium? How useful is this concept in theory, and in practice? 2. The concept of Walrasian equilibrium is useless because the same good usually has diﬀerent prices in diﬀerent shops. Discuss. 3. Consider a closed economy with two industries: food, produced using labour and land; and clothing, produced using labour and capital. Labour is mobile between industries. Suppose technological progress leads to a rise in total factor productivity in the clothing industry. Analyse the eﬀects on employment, consumption, and the distribution of income. 4. Do workers gain or lose from liberalization of international trade? 5. Who gains and who loses from international trade? How does your answer depend on the mobility of factors of production between sectors? 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
