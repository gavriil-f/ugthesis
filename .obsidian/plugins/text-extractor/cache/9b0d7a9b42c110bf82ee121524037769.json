Questions with sub-sections (e.g. Q1a(i), Q1a(ii), etc) should all be answered as part of your response for the corresponding overall question number. This paper contains twenty questions. Answer THREE questions. There is a word limit of 1,600 words per answer. A12693W1 2 1. ‘Knowledge can’t be analysed; but the various conditions that feature in the unsuccessful analyses nonetheless capture everything that is valuable about knowledge.’ Is this a fair assessment? 2. ‘Even when p entails q, there can be evidence for p that is not evidence for q. So beliefs formed by deduction from things we know needn’t themselves be knowledge.’ Is this a compelling argument? 3. If the epistemic standards governing assertion are lower in an informal conversation than in a courtroom or at a scientific conference, does this support epistemic contextualism? 4. EITHER (a) ‘But it would be morally awful to believe that!’ Is this ever relevant to whether a belief is epistemically justified? OR (b) ‘All that matters to justification is how likely the claim is to be true.’ Is this correct? 5. ‘Internalism about epistemic justification is well-motivated only if our knowledge of our own minds is special in way X. But our knowledge of our own minds is not special in way X.’ Is there a compelling version of this argument? 6. EITHER (a) ‘Evidence E can justify someone in believing P, only if they have prior justification to reject the conjunction (E and not-P). Our perceptual evidence can, in fact, justify us in believing a host of things about the external world. So we must have a priori justification to reject a wide range of substantive and highly contingent hypotheses.’ Is this a good argument? OR (b) ‘Most a priori knowledge is a mystery. So there is no good argument against the view that we simply know a priori that our perceptual faculties are reliable.’ Discuss. 7. Should perceptual and inductive scepticism receive parallel responses? 8. Is eavesdropping a way of gaining knowledge by testimony? 9. Does it matter if you are not taken seriously as a knower? 10. Does time pass at a particular rate? What follows if it doesn’t? 11. Could any two distinct things have been identical? 12. ‘The only mode of composition is mereological composition.’ Is this true? A12693W1 3 13. Are you a sum of temporal parts, an instantaneous temporal part of such a sum, or neither? 14. Suppose every day I replace one of the parts of my watch, W, and I keep the replaced parts in a box. Once I have replaced all the parts, I have a working watch, W*, that is spatiotemporally continuous with W. Suppose a couple of days later I take the original parts out of the box and assemble them together in the original way, thereby getting a watch, W**, with the original parts of W. Which one, if either, is W, the watch spatiotemporally continuous with it, or the watch with its original parts? 15. ‘Theories that reject universals face a vicious infinite regress of resemblances. Therefore, at least a universal of resemblance must be accepted. And once this universal is accepted, there is no reason to develop theories that reject universals such as redness and squareness.’ Is this a good point against resemblance theories? 16. Should we explain essence in terms of necessity, or necessity in terms of essence? 17. Does the truth predicate stand for a property? If so, which one? 18. ‘It can be true that you used to be a person but it can never be true that you used to be an animal.’ Is this right? Is it relevant to questions of our identity? 19. ‘Given that the modal is grounded in the non-modal, we should explain counterfactuals in terms of causation rather than vice versa.’ Is this correct? 20. ‘It doesn’t matter whether race is real or not – what matters is only what we believe about it.’ Discuss.
