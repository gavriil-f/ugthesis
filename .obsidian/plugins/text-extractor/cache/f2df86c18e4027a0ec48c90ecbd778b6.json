Markets are an important mechanism for allocating scarce resources and are amongst the institutions studied by economists. Governments also allocate scarce resources (using taxation, cash transfers and public expenditure) so we study them too. Crime is another allocation mechanism which we study, as are charities, lotteries, cooperatives and clubs. We look at those as well. Opportunity Cost The cost of a university education This includes not only tuition fees and equipment, but also the value of the salary that would have been earned during the time at university, but was not. Some apparent \"costs\" are not opportunity costs - e.g. living costs which you will incur whether or not you go to university. These are part of the cost of an education only insofar as they are more expensive than they would otherwise be. If they are subsidised then they are in fact a benefit. Similarly, the expenditures on things you would have otherwise done represent savings. Economic Methods & Analysis Homo economicus There is a frequent assumption in Economics that people are extremely selfish relative to most people we know. We then model the choices that people make, assuming that they acting in their own self-interest. Homo economicus is not a descriptively accurate model of people in general; so why make the assumption? Economic Methods & Analysis To build an effective model we need to distinguish between • the essential features of the economy that are relevant to the question we want to answer, which should be included in the model • unimportant details that can be ignored Models necessarily omit many details. This is a feature, not a bug. Economic Methods & Analysis Economists reason by building models: - Capture the (relevant) elements of the economy or phenomenon we are trying to analyse - Describe how agents act, and how they interact with each other and their (economic) environment - Determine the outcomes of these actions: an equilibrium - Study what happens (how the equilibrium changes) when conditions change – comparative statics Economic Methods & Analysis Models help by removing extraneous details from a problem so that what remains can be understood more readily. Apply Occam's Razor: models should as simple as possible while still allowing us to understand the issues at hand and to illuminate connections between ideas. The Methodology of Economics At heart Economics is perhaps a set of methods: tools for approaching certain classes of problems. Methodology is the philosophy of scientific methods. It is related to epistemology (the study of theories of knowledge or ways of knowing). The Methodology of Economics - Instrumentalism \"A hypothesis is rejected if its predictions are contradicted; it is accepted if its predictions are not contradicted; great confidence is attached to it if it has survived many opportunities for contradiction. Factual evidence can never \"prove\" a hypothesis, it can only fail to disprove it.\" Milton Friedman (1953) The Methodology of Economics - Instrumentalism But most economists these days would not go as far as Friedman. • The primacy of predictions can lead researchers to look for reliable correlations rather than truly causal relationships. • False premises can lead to true conclusions. • Theories are rendered more/less adequate, not true/false. and, not least, • Predictive performance in economics is rather unimpressive…","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
