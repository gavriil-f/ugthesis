The material conditional is true if either the antecedent is false or the consequent (Y) is true. “If CB didn’t write TMR, somebody else did” — seems to be saying that CB not being the writer of TMR guarantees that somebody else is the writer. The material conditional gives the right analysis here. The material conditional is poorly suited for counterfactuals. “If CB hadn’t writen TMR, somebody else would have” — true! “If CB had died aged 5, he would have written TMR” — true! Possible worlds: “if the glass had dropped, it would have broken” means that in those possible worlds in which the glass drops, it breaks. But what about worlds in which a pillow has been put under the glass?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
