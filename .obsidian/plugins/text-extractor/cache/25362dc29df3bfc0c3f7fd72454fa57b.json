{"path":".library/attachments/Nagel2016 .pdf","text":"Goldman and His Criti C s philosophers and their critics General Editor: Ernest Lepore Philosophy is an interactive enterprise. Much of it is carried out in dialogue as theories and ideas are presented and subsequently refined in the crucible of close scrutiny. The purpose of this series is to reconstruct this vital interplay among thinkers. Each book consists of a temporary assessment of an important living philosopher’s work. A collection of essays written by an interdisciplinary group of critics addressing the substantial theses of the philosopher’s corpus opens each volume. In the last section, the philosopher responds to his or her critics, clarifies crucial points of the discussion, or updates his or her doctrines. 1 Dretske and His Critics Edited by Brian P.

McLaughlin, who invested huge amounts of time and energy to this project, from conception to final execution. i have debts to each of them for many things over many years, but their work on this project exceeds everything that went before. To the authors of the volume’s chapters i am also exceedingly grateful. i could not have imagined a more astute and incisive assemblage of critics. i very much appreciate the careful and thorough pieces of philosophy (and cognitive science, in some instances) that they collectively directed toward a wide range of my writings. it is possible that i originally misread the proposed volume’s title. i thought it read “Goldman and His ‘Critics’,” with scare quotes around ‘Critics.’ So i wasn’t initially prepared for the tough‐minded seriousness of the critiques i encountered. Nonetheless, i pulled myself together and wrote replies with roughly comparable levels of seriousness; at any rate, as serious as could be mounted sub- ject to my 1000‐word limit per reply. Thanks for the workout, my friends. Alvin i. Goldman (September, 2015) Preface This volume contains sixteen essays on Alvin Goldman’s work and his replies to them. Many of the essays focus on Goldman’s contributions to epistemology, both individual and social. Others deal with his important contributions to philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of mind – especially simulation theory – and metaphysics. It is diffi- cult to contain the range of Goldman’s interests and contributions within the covers of a single volume. Goldman’s contributions to epistemology, beginning almost fifty years ago with “A  Causal Theory of Knowing” (1967), completely changed the field. His externalism brought about a paradigm shift in epistemological theorizing from the centrality of the would‐be knower’s perspective to a third‐person view of the features in virtue of which a belief is justified. Part and parcel of this shift was a move away from what Goldman called a “current time slice view” of justification, according to which the justificational status of a belief at a given time depends exclusively on features of the believer at that time, in favor of a historical theory of justification, which makes a belief ’s justificatory status depend on features of its causal ancestry. Goldman has elaborated and defended this externalist view in ever greater detail and depth over the years, and the debate between externalists and internalists continues to be a focus of discussion in the epistemological literature. It is thus appropriate that a number of papers here are addressed to that issue. Once one adopts an externalist approach to epistemological issues, the exclusive focus on features of individual knowers that had been so prevalent within the epistemological literature begins to look misguided. Much that goes on within individuals is, to be sure, relevant to epistemological concerns. But features of the social environment are ripe for epistemological analysis as well, and, especially beginning with Knowledge in a Social World (1999), Goldman has played a crucial role not only in highlighting the importance of these social features, but in developing a full‐scale social epistemology. These concerns are reflected in a number of the contributions to this volume. Goldman’s work in philosophy of mind and cognitive science rightly receive attention here as well. Goldman gave one of the earliest articulations and defenses of the simulation account of self‐knowledge, a view he presented most fully in Simulating Minds: The Philosophy, Psychology, and Neuroscience of Mindreading (2006), and which he further Pref A C e xi elaborated in the papers collected in Joint Ventures: Mindreading, Mirroring, and Embodied Cognition (2013). finally, Goldman’s work in metaphysics, influenced, as so much of his work is, by results in the cognitive sciences, is also the focus of attention here. Throughout his career, Goldman’s work has been a model of interdisciplinary research and of scientifically informed philosophy. He has co‐authored work not only with other  philosophers, but with economists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and lawyers. The breadth of his vision, the care and clarity with which he has worked out his ideas, the originality and scope of his views, have all contributed to the importance of his work. Goldman’s evident pleasure in interacting with other researchers, and the tremendous contributions he has made by way of those interactions, can be seen here in his replies to the contributors to this volume. We have all profited from these interactions over many years, and it is our pleasure that this volume should serve as a token of our appreciation for Goldman’s many seminal contributions. We would like to thank Sam Carter for his help with editorial work and for preparing the index. Reliabilism, Internalism, and Externalism Part I Goldman and His Critics, First Edition. Edited by Brian P. McLaughlin and Hilary Kornblith. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Internalism, Reliabilism, and Deontology M I chael W I ll I a M s 1 1 Internalism and the Reliabilist Revolution Since the 1960s, Anglophone epistemology has undergone a paradigm‐shift: “the Reliabilist Revolution.” The revolutionary‐in‐chief has been Alvin Goldman. Reliabilism names a family of views. According to Goldman’s version, knowledge is true belief acquired and sustained by some reliable cognitive process or procedure: that is, a process or procedure that tends to produce true beliefs and to avoid producing false ones. Other versions avoid the reference to cognitive processes or procedures and equate knowledge with true belief that in some appropriate way counterfactually co‐varies with the facts: for example, had it not been the case that p, I would not have believed that p (“sensitivity”), or that in believing that p I could not easily have gone wrong (“safety”) i. I won’t be concerned with whether one approach is superior. Nor will I investigate the best way to formulate either. Rather, my focus will be on a central element in all versions: the shift from an “internal- ist” to an “externalist” approach to understanding knowledge and justification. Goldman’s assessment of “internalism” is negative in the extreme. He argues not merely that his “externalist” understanding of knowledge is superior to any “internalist” rival but that internalism suffers from crippling defects: “fundamental problems that lie at the core of internalism.” Further, he claims to have challenged “the viability of [internalism’s] most prominent rationale” (Goldman 1999 [2002]: 3). ii He finds this putative rationale in what he calls the guidance‐deontological (“GD”) approach to justification, according to which justi- fication depends on self‐consciously living up to one’s epistemic obligations. As Goldman notes, the GD approach has a long history. Arguably, it was the dominant approach prior to  the Reliabilist Revolution: hardly surprising, given that in the pre‐revolutionary era 4 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y virtually all epistemologists were internalists of one kind or another. iii Indeed, there is a case for saying that the internalist/externalist contrast itself – or at least a clear awareness of its importance – is a product of the Revolution, though we would have to add that how the distinction is best understood is a matter of debate. I agree that “internalism,” as Goldman understands it, should be repudiated. but as Goldman recognizes, the GD approach to understanding knowledge and justification does not, in and of itself, require us to adopt the kind of internalism he rejects. So I shall argue for two lemmas. The first is that Goldman has not adequately diagnosed the sources of the untenable internalism that is his principal target: additional commitments must be brought to light. The second is that dispensing with these commitments opens the way to an approach to knowledge and justification that is “internalist” by a standard that Goldman himself recognizes, yet free of the drawbacks he brings to our attention. my conclusion is that internalist justification needs refinement, not rejection. This means, in turn, that the GD conception of justification also survives. 2 Internalism’s burdens According to Goldman, the distinction between an “externalist” and an “internalist” conception of justification turns on contrasting answers to the question of whether or not justification‐conferring properties must be accessible to the subject. He writes: externalism characteristically holds that beliefs acquire justificational status if they are produced by methods with certain “external” properties, properties that need not be known – and perhaps need not be knowable, or at any rate “directly” knowable – by the agent himself. Internalism takes issue with this claim about proper methods or pathways. It holds that all justification‐conferring properties (“justifiers,” for short) must be accessible to the agent. (PK: vii) However, although we might reasonably take insistence on the “accessibility” of justifiers to be the essential feature of internalism, in doing so we would fall short of characterizing internalism as Goldman understands it. For Goldman, internalism is not just the view that justifiers be knowable. There is the further requirement that “only internal conditions qualify as legitimate determiners of justification,” so that “justification must be a purely internal affair” (PK: 3) “Internal” here means “internal to the subject”: justifiers, at least in the first instance, are mental states (or facts concerning such states). The “internalism” that Goldman repudiates is subjectivist internalism. Goldman is surely right that subjectivist internalism has enjoyed a long run in episte- mology; and he argues convincingly that its run deserves to come to an end. He advances three major conclusions: 1 Internalism leads to skepticism. In its strong form, internalism restricts legitimate justifiers so severely that beliefs that intuitively count as justified turn out to be unjustified. Attempts to liberalize internalism do not repair the damage. INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 5 2 Internalism incorporates an untenable methodology of epistemology. Internalism “standardly incorporates the doctrine that epistemology is a purely a priori or armchair enterprise rather than one that needs help from empirical science.” However, the hallmark of epistemic justification is truth‐conduciveness; and the truth‐conduciveness of the procedure of guiding one’s beliefs by internal states is an empirical matter. (We have learned that some of our natural ways of thinking are not always truth‐reliable.) 3 Internalism lacks a cogent rationale. The main (only?) rationale for internalism derives from the GD conception of justification. but in itself, the GD conception does not support internalism. Goldman calls this the “core dilemma” for the “Three Step Argument” for internalism (PK: 17–18). There is something to each of these points, though not as much as Goldman claims. On the first point, I agree that many traditional forms of internalism lead to skepti- cism. So I can deal briefly with Goldman’s arguments to that effect. Internalism, as Goldman understands it, confines justifiers to facts concerning mental states. “Strong Internalism” (SI) is even more demanding, restricting justifiers to facts about occurrent, conscious mental states. Thus: (SI) Only facts concerning what conscious states an agent is in at time t are justifiers of the agent’s beliefs at t. (PK: 8) Strong Internalism is no straw man. As Goldman says, Chisholm – surely one of the most influential American epistemologists of the last century – says many things that commit him to such a view. iv Strong Internalism falls to the problem of stored beliefs. most of one’s beliefs are stored in memory; and even when a belief is consciously entertained, it does not come accompa- nied by all beliefs relevant to its status as a justifier for other beliefs. Given Strong Internalism, then, almost none of our beliefs is justified. Internalists might reply that justification for a belief requires only a disposition to generate conscious evidential states as justifiers for consciously entertained beliefs. However, it is doubtful whether a Strong Internalist can accept this suggestion. The fact of possessing a disposition is not the sort of thing that can be known at an instant by introspection. Allowing dispositions to count as justifiers threatens to open the door to externalism. Suppose that we liberalize internalism by expanding the class of justifiers to incorpo- rate stored mental states: this Weak Internalism falls to the problem of forgotten evidence. We do not normally suppose that for a belief to remain justified I must be able to recall all the evidence or reasons that justified it at the time of acquisition, and imposing such a requirement would have extensive, skeptical implications. As Goldman says, a belief can be justified (and in the absence of countervailing considerations remain justified) by virtue of being acquired in an epistemically proper way. but “past acquisition is irrelevant by the lights of internalism,” strong or weak, since all past events are “external” to an agent’s current mental states and capacities (PK: 10). Internalism has been defended in both foundationalist and coherentist versions. However, both versions make appeal to logical or probabilistic relations, either to connect 6 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y basic with non‐basic beliefs or to contribute to the coherence of one’s overall belief system. Since such relations do not concern either occurrent or stored mental states, it is unclear how internalists are entitled to count them as justifiers. A further liberalization seems called for: we must credit an agent with some computa- tional capacities that allow him to determine whether a targeted proposition stands in appropriate logical or probabilistic relations to other relevant belief‐states. but now we face the problem of the doxastic decision interval. Suppose that one’s belief‐system contains 138 atomic propositions: just checking for consistency, using the truth table method and employing an ideal computer working at top speed, would take 20 billion years, which makes nonsense of the idea of being justified at a time. Furthermore, algorithms like the truth‐table method are not in the conscious repertoire of most human beings: does this mean that most people have no justified beliefs? No doubt we have sub‐personal compu- tational skills and procedures that are reliable enough in ordinary circumstances. but the possession of such skills is precisely the kind of external fact that internalists exclude from justificational relevance. Not surprisingly: what skills we possess, and how reliable they are, are manifestly empirical matters. Finally, there is the question of whether the class of justifiers should include epistemic principles. Goldman argues that it should: “epistemic principles are among the items that determine whether a belief is justified, which is just how ‘justifiers’ was defined” (PK: 16). but internalists have a special reason for so treating them. The rationale for internalism rests on the GD conception of justification, according to which justification depends on fulfilling one’s epistemic obligations; and an agent’s knowledge of her inter- nal states “will not instruct her about her epistemic duties and entitlements unless she also knows true epistemic principles” (PK: 16). Unfortunately for internalists, it is doubtful whether ordinary agents are capable of formulating and recognizing such prin- ciples. even professional epistemologists, who have made formulating epistemic princi- ples their business, have never reached consensus. It seems that no such principles are known to anyone. by internalist standards, most people  –  possibly all people  –  know nothing whatsoever. These are fair points. but what should we learn from them? That there is nothing to internalism? That the GD conception should be rejected as such? “No” to both questions. 3 Goldman’s Incomplete Diagnosis We saw that Goldman distinguishes internalism from externalism in two ways. One way invokes contrasting answers to the question of whether justifiers must be knowable by the subject, internalists saying “yes” and externalists “no.” The other appeals to a difference in the factors that the two schools of thought are willing to count as justifiers. Internalists restrict justifiers to the subject’s “internal” states, whereas externalists countenance justi- fiers involving relations to “external”  –  that is, extra‐mental  –  conditions. Adding the second “internalist” requirement to the first yields a form of internalism – subjectivist internalism – that has attracted influential advocates. but so far, we have seen no reason to suppose that this addition is mandatory or even well‐motivated. INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 7 Now in Goldman’s view, these two ways of drawing the internalist/externalist distinction are closely related, at least in the minds of internalists. Adopting the GD conception of justification leads internalists to impose the knowability constraint, which they then take to require treating justification as an “internal” affair. Thus: 1 The GD conception of justification is posited. 2 A certain constraint on the determiners of justification is derived from the GD con- ception, that is, the constraint that all justification determiners must be accessible to, or knowable by, the epistemic agent. 3 The accessibility or knowability constraint is taken to imply that only internal condi- tions qualify as legitimate determiners of justification. So justification must be a purely internal affair. This is the rationale for internalism that Goldman claims to undermine and which he calls “The Three Step Argument” for internalism. However, baldly stated, the Three Step Argument doesn’t get us anywhere. We can agree that the GD concep- tion mandates some kind of knowability constraint: that justifiers be knowable is the essential feature of internalism, according to Goldman’s initial characterization. Our question was why the knowability constraint should be thought to restrict justifiers to internal states. The Three Step Argument takes this further step, but without explaining why. We need to look more closely at the knowability constraint on justifiers. Here is Goldman’s initial formulation: (KJ) The only facts that qualify as justifiers of an agent’s believing p at time t are facts that the agent can readily know, at t, to obtain or not to obtain. (KJ) is supposed to follow from the GD conception, on the grounds that we cannot guide assent by inaccessible factors. but even allowing that (KJ) follows from the GD concep- tion  –  something we shall find reason to question  –  we have been given no reason to suppose that external justifiers cannot meet it. Goldman recognizes this, noting that internalists impose the stronger condition: (KJ dir) The only facts that qualify as justifiers of an agent’s believing p at time t are facts that the agent can readily know directly, at t, to obtain or not to obtain. (Goldman 1999: 277) Again, we have to ask “Why?” Goldman’s answer is that tacit recognition of the insuffi- ciency of (KJ) is what “undoubtedly” leads internalists to favor the “direct knowability” constraint. The problem they then face is that this more restrictive knowability constraint is not mandated by the GD conception. This means that, even if (KJ) follows from the GD conception, we have no argument for internalism. Internalism, as Goldman con- strues it, depends on (KJ dir), and (KJdir) does not follow from the GD conception. This is the “core dilemma” for the Three Step Argument, thus for internalism itself (unless internalism has some alternative rationale). 8 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y Goldman is right to point out that subjectivist internalism does not follow from (KJ), and so does not follow from the GD conception. He is also correct in noting that propo- nents of the GD conception often do restrict justifiers to “internal” states of the knower, such as perceptual appearings or ostensible memories, characterizing such states in ways that make no reference to “external” (extra‐mental or environmental) conditions. Typically, they also embrace the view that the epistemic principles that guide us in form- ing and retaining our beliefs – for example, those linking our basic evidence with beliefs about the world around us – must be discoverable a priori, by reflection alone. but while Goldman is right that internalists often do take on these commitments, he falls short when it comes to explaining why. Goldman claims that internalists substitute (KJdir) for (KJ) because they recognize that the latter is too weak to support their subjectivism, or as Goldman would have it “internalism.” but if this is so, they must already be inclined to take their internalism in a subjectivist direction. Unless this inclination is wholly unmotivated – which seems unlikely – considerations beyond the GD conception must be in play. Goldman senses this problem, which is why he claims that recognition, on the part of subjectivist internalists, that (KJ) is not fit for the purpose is “tacit.” but this is simply false: internalists of the traditional kind have reasons for preferring (KJdir). Goldman’s diagnostic argument is incomplete because these reasons do not figure in his exposé of internalism. We must bring them into the open. Neutralizing them is the key to develop- ing a non‐subjectivist epistemology that takes guidance by reasons to play an essential role in epistemic justification. Such an epistemology will be internalist, according to Goldman’s initial characterization of internalism, but not vulnerable to his criticisms. 4 The Roots of Subjectivism let us agree that the GD conception imposes some kind of knowability constraint on justi- fiers. (We will examine just what kind of knowability constraint later.) let us further agree that any approach to justification that imposes such a constraint is generically internalist. The question is: what considerations push generic internalism towards subjectivism? The aim of epistemology is to understand knowledge and justification. v but what kind of explanation are we looking for? much traditional epistemology has sought what we can call a vindicating explanation: in Kant’s famous terms, an answer to Quid juris? and not merely to Quid facti? So understood, the task of epistemology is not to record what, as a matter of fact, we believe, but rather to explain in some general way how we are entitled to hold the beliefs we do. Or to put the point another way, why at least some of our beliefs amount to knowledge rather than mere opinion. In this spirit, it is sometimes said that the task of epistemology is to show how knowledge is possible, given that it is possible. However, we only understand the task of showing how knowledge is possible because there are seemingly plausible arguments – skeptical arguments – for the conclusion that knowledge is impossible. If epistemology is supposed to provide a general vindication of our pretension to know things about the world around us, responding to skepticism becomes a controlling aim of epistemological theory. INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 9 In tracing the path to subjectivism, we must begin with the skepticism that arises from the supposed threat of an infinite regress of justification, or as I like to say from Agrippa’s Trilemma. I make a claim. The skeptic (who may just be me in a reflective frame of mind) asks “How do you know (or why do you believe) that?” I explain, perhaps by citing some evidence, or giving my credentials: it doesn’t matter. The skeptic then reiterates his ques- tion: “How do you know that?” Three possibilities emerge. I can: 1 keep responding by finding something new to say, in which case I embark on a vicious infinite regress; or 2 at some point, refuse to answer, in which case my “knowledge” rests on a mere assumption; or 3 recur to something I have already said, in which case my reasoning is circular. In no case do I explain how I know. Seeing no fourth option, the skeptic concludes that knowledge (or justification) is impossible. Granting that there is no fourth option, while holding that knowledge is nevertheless possible, the constructive epistemologist must argue that we can put a better face on one of the options the skeptic dismisses. Since most philosophers (and as far as I know all proponents of the GD conception) agree that an infinite regress of justifiers is a non‐ starter,vi taking the Agrippan problem at face value forces a choice between two broad strategies. The foundationalist strategy is to argue that there are basic beliefs: beliefs that are justified in a way that involves no dependence on further reasons. The coherentist strategy is to maintain that the charge of circularity rests on a misguided “linear” concep- tion of justification, according to which a justified belief derives it positive status from prior beliefs in some chain of justification. In fact, justification is an emergent property of belief‐systems, arising from complex interrelations (explanatory, probabilistic, etc.) among their elements. An individual belief is justified by virtue of being an element in such a system.vii As Goldman notes, the kind of internalism he objects to can be found in both camps. However, for traditionally minded adherents of the GD conception, foundationalism has been the option of choice. This is not surprising. Assessing one’s total belief‐system for coherence is no easy task, if it is possible at all. So I shall focus on the route from founda- tionalism to subjectivism, though I think that comparable considerations apply to coher- entism too. Now while subjectivist internalists are committed to substantive anti‐skepticism, meth- odological skepticism is built into their project of “showing how knowledge is possible.” Chisholm’s approach to epistemology is a perfect illustration. Chisholm investigates the justification for our everyday beliefs by way of “Socratic” questioning: that is, starting from everyday beliefs of some broad kind, such as beliefs concerning objects and events in our immediate environment, he reiterates the demand for justification until he finds facts that are “directly evident.” Commitment to (KJ dir) arises from the need to find regress stoppers: facts that can be directly – that is, non‐inferentially – known. Traditional foundationalists are explicit about this. Pace Goldman, there is nothing tacit about their commitment to justifiers that are directly known. 10 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y While this is the first piece of the puzzle concerning the grounds for advancing (KJdir) in preference to the generic (KJ), it cannot be the whole story. Subjectivist internalists think that the basic beliefs that bring the regress of justification to a halt are not merely non‐inferentially justified (in some sense of “non‐inferentially”) but intrinsically credible. This is a strong demand, which everyday beliefs about things around us do not evidently meet, even though they might well be thought to be non‐inferential. Why the quest for beliefs that are non‐inferentially justified turns into a quest for beliefs that are intrinsically credible is not immediately clear. As Goldman remarks, externalist‐reliabilists have a perfectly good account of basic non‐inferential knowledge: it is true belief arising directly from the exercise of a reliable cognitive capacity. but since perception is such a capacity, we have been given no reason to exclude facts about objects and events in the world around us from the category of facts that may be known non‐inferentially to obtain. It follows that even (KJdir) is insufficient to enforce subjectivist internalism. If this is right, the transition to subjectivism must involve further commitments. What might these be? One plausible candidate is evidentialism: (e) It is one’s epistemic duty, always and everywhere, to guide assent by evidence. Since the evidence for our beliefs about the world around us is provided by perceptual experience, we may seem to have taken a step towards subjectivism. but we are not yet there. externalist reliabilists can grant that beliefs about things around us are causally mediated, and in that sense guided, by perceptual experience. The guidance by evidence that (e) demands cannot be merely causal. We saw at the outset that all forms of internalism, in so far as they are derived from the GD conception, are committed to some measure of epistemic self‐consciousness in the regulation of assent. We should make this commitment explicit: (esc) It is one’s epistemic duty, always and everywhere, to self‐consciously guide assent by evidence. Applying (esc) to the guidance of beliefs about the world by experience, puts us well on the way to the subjectivist internalism Goldman deplores. but why should we think that (e sc) applies always and everywhere? In particular, why should we not think that basic non‐inferential knowledge is just the kind of knowledge that (esc) does not apply to? And if we take the existence of basic, non‐inferential knowledge to preclude (esc)’s being universally applicable, what is the barrier to accepting that externalist reliabilism offers the simplest and most plausible account of such knowledge? If there is no such barrier, there will be no reason to confine non‐inferential knowledge to knowledge of “internal states”. Such knowledge can concern how things are in the world around us, which is how we ordinarily understand it.viii There is reason for proponents to the GD conception to reject this line of thought. Once we admit that we cannot sensibly insist on applying (e sc) to basic non‐inferential knowledge, it is not clear why we should insist on applying it to all non‐basic knowledge. Indeed, the considerations Goldman calls attention to are powerful reasons for not doing INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 11 so. This is not to say that we do not sometimes self‐consciously guide assent by attending to evidence. It is, however, to concede that such self‐conscious belief management is not, and realistically could not be, the rule. This is a serious worry concerning the GD conception in general, thus not specific to subjectivist internalism. However, I want to set it aside for the moment, since there is a deeper reason why subjectivist internalists  –  we might say traditional epistemolo- gists – resist externalist‐reliabilism. This is that it does not seem to them to offer a vindi- cating explanation of knowledge (or justification) at the right level of generality. The traditional epistemologist is seeking an explanation of how it is possible for us to know (or be justified in believing) anything whatsoever, or perhaps anything whatsoever in certain very broad categories: facts about the external world, for example. Arguably, an externalist‐ reliabilist account of our commonsense and scientific knowledge of the world fails to provide the vindicating explanation that the traditional epistemologist requires, since it offers an explanation of how knowledge and justified belief arise from within the very picture of the world and our place in it that stands in need of vindication. Spelled out, the objection is that to answer the traditional epistemologist’s skeptically driven question in externalist‐reliabilist terms is to fall into some form of epistemic circu- larity. Underwriting this concern is commitment to what is sometimes called the Principle of the Criterion (PC). ernest Sosa formulates the Principle as follows: (PC) Knowledge is enhanced by justified trust in the reliability of its sources. (Sosa 2009: 139) Some sources of knowledge are derivative: we can justify our trust in them by evidence from other sources. but surely some sources of knowledge – perception and memory, for example – are fundamental: we can justify our trust in such sources of knowledge only by relying on those very sources. The question immediately arises: how can such trust be explained in a way that avoids epistemic circularity? Sosa calls this “The Pyrrhonian Problematic” (Sosa 2009: esp. chs 7– 9). ix The problem is to stop the regress of justifica- tion without courting even epistemic circularity. According to subjectivist internalists, this is a problem that externalist‐reliabilist accounts of basic knowledge cannot solve. Sosa argues that this is not so. externalists can solve the problem by distinguishing two grades of knowledge, which he calls “animal” and “reflective” (Sosa 2009: ch 7). Animal knowledge is to be understood in externalist‐reliabilist terms. Sosa argues for a version of Virtue Reliabilism, but the details don’t matter here. The vital point is that the existence of some such primitive kind of knowledge ensures that some of our beliefs have a measure of justification, a positive epistemic standing, that does not depend on our having justified trust in their sources. by virtue of its positive standing, animal knowl- edge can provide a basis on which to construct a justified picture of the world and our place in it that explains why and to what extent the fundamental cognitive capacities that give rise to animal knowledge are indeed trustworthy. Starting from knowledge that is merely animal, we rise to the level of reflective knowledge. In so doing, we acquire the general vindicating understanding of our epistemic capacities that epistemology has always sought. We can come to satisfy the Principle of the Criterion without having always already satisfied it. 12 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y This is a powerful and intriguing response to the Pyrrhonian Problematic. but it works only because Sosa’s version of the Principle of the Criterion is, by traditional standards, rather weak. (PC) asserts only that knowledge is enhanced by justified trust in its sources. but much traditional epistemology has embraced, if only implicitly, the Strong Principle of the Criterion: (SPC) Knowledge requires justified trust in the reliability of its sources. (SPC) precludes understanding any knowledge in purely externalist‐reliabilist terms. This prohibition on invoking a reliabilist account of positive epistemic status is not only in force if we set non‐inferential knowledge at the level of beliefs about the external world: it applies equally well to our experiential beliefs (or to whatever kind of belief‐like aware- ness we might suppose to be involved in perceptual or memorial experience itself). In the context of methodological skepticism and under the twin constraints of (esc) and (SPC), the demand for regress stoppers turns into the demand for knowledge that is absolutely non‐inferential. Such knowledge must be encapsulated: the states of awareness that give rise to it cannot owe their epistemic standing to any presuppositions regarding facts exter- nal to themselves. In other words, basic beliefs must be intrinisically credible. As we saw, even (KJdir) is too weak to lead us to subjectivist internalism, if “direct” means no more than “non‐inferential.” What the subjectivist internalist really needs – and feels obliged to impose – is: (KJ ani) The only facts that qualify as justifiers of an agent’s believing p at time t are facts that the agent can readily know absolutely non‐inferentially, at t, to obtain or not to obtain. On this conception of basic knowledge, the facts that give rise to it must involve self‐ presenting states. Such states constitute self‐vindicating sources of evidence. Subjectivism now follows because beliefs concerning one’s own internal states are the only remotely plausible candidates for this kind of epistemic privilege (at least for empirical knowl- edge). Only with respect to internal, psychological states is there the faintest plausibility to the claim that being in such a state is sufficient for knowing that one is. Of course, whatever its merits as a response to the Agrippan (regress) problem, restricting basic knowledge to knowledge of one’s internal states leads straight to the standard array of “Cartesian” skeptical problems. Thus restricted, our basic knowledge appears to seriously underdetermine what we may justifiably believe about “external” matters. If perceptual experience yields “direct” knowledge only of how thing appear to me, and if the course of my experience could be just what it has been even if I were the victim of Descartes’ evil Deceiver or a brain in a vat, then how am I justified in believing anything at all about the external world? If basic knowledge concerns “internal,” states but we nevertheless have knowledge of “external” matters, there must be epistemic principles linking basic with non‐basic knowl- edge. Such principles must be available to reflect on and justified a priori. but as Goldman rightly complains, such principles are problematic from the standpoint of the GD concep- tion. People who lack the vocabulary even to formulate them – just about everyone who isn’t a professional epistemologist – cannot self‐consciously guide assent in the light of them. but as already noted, not even epistemologists know whether any such principles are even true. INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 13 Summing up, the roots of subjectivist internalism lie in a particular conception of the task of epistemology: showing how knowledge is possible, under the twin constraints of (e sc) and (SPC). It is far from evident that the GD conception of justification commits us to these requirements. 5 Defending the GD conception Whatever reliabilists think, no adequate account of human knowledge can steer clear of deontological considerations. The reason is that the status of epistemic subject is essen- tially connected with accountability. To be an epistemic subject just is being accountable for what one believes, in the way that being an agent just is being accountable for what one does. Despite affinities and continuities, human knowledge differs from animal cognition in the way that human action differs from animal behavior. To be justified (or knowledge- able) in one’s beliefs is to be epistemically entitled to them, thus licensed to use them in reasoning, to pass them on to others, and so on. To be knowledgeable is to be onside in the game of assertion. And as in soccer, the sanctions associated with an infringement of the rules are internal. If a subject turns out not to be knowledgeable with respect to a certain proposition, the assertional license that he has been (mistakenly) granted, or that he has taken himself to possess, lapses. This is what epistemic accountability amounts to. Seen in this light, neither knowledge nor justified belief is straightforwardly a “mental state.” If we want to talk about knowledge as a mental state, we must recognize that it is a mental state that is not only factive but implies a distinctive deontic status. To occupy this status – to be knowledgeable – a subject must satisfy two desiderata. The first is due dili- gence or epistemically responsible belief‐management. The antonym of “responsible” is “irre- sponsible.” (epistemic accountability might also be called “epistemic responsibility,” but here the sense of “responsible” would be quite different. Here the antonym of “responsi- ble” – if there is one – would be “non‐responsible.”) The second desideratum is that a subject’s epistemic procedure – the method or process that formed and sustains his belief – must be suitably reliable. The first condition on knowledge (and justification) is stated in deontological terms; the second is not. but the two desiderata are intimately connected. One obvious connection is that due diligence is a desideratum by virtue of promoting reliability. Reliabilists are right about this, though there is more to be said. x, xi So far, I have said nothing about the role of reasons or evidence in producing or sus- taining entitlement. but there must be some connection. To be accountable for one’s beliefs is to be liable to be held to account for them. Accountable beings must therefore have the capacity to account for themselves: that is, possessors of epistemic entitlement must be capable of establishing or defending such entitlement. This is an “internalist” demand, according to Goldman’s initial definition, which requires that subjects have some access to justifiers. If we accept it, three further demands follow immediately: 1 In so far as knowledge and justification require adherence to proper standards of epis- temic conduct, adhering to those standards must involve more than conforming to them: it must involve (in some way) recognizing or being guided by them. 14 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 2 being justified in one’s beliefs must have an essential connection with the practice of justifying them. being justified will involve the capacity to explain how and why one believes as one does. 3 Since vindicating a claim to knowledge often involves giving one’s credentials – e.g. appealing to the reliability of one’s recognitional capacities – epistemic subjects must not only possess reliable cognitive capacities, they must know something about how reli- able those capacities are. These requirements tie knowledge (and justification) to epistemic self‐consciousness. Without epistemic self‐consciousness, there is no epistemic accountability; and beings that are not accountable for their beliefs are not epistemic subjects in the way that mature human beings are. They are not beings that can be justified or unjustified in their beliefs, if they can be said to have beliefs at all. How does this approach to understanding knowledge and justification avoid the slide into subjectivism? To insist that subjects not only be reliable with respect to certain epis- temic procedures or processes, but also know about the reliability of these procedures or processes, is to impose (SPC). Aren’t we therefore back in the Pyrrhonian Problematic, so that Goldman is right after all? mustn’t we choose between subjectivist internalism and externalist reliabilism? No. As we saw, the sources of subjectivism involve more than (SPC), thus epistemic self‐consciousness. They impose (SPC) in the context of methodo- logical skepticism. but it should not be assumed that giving a straightforward answer to the skeptic is epistemology’s first order of business. We should also keep in mind the subjec- tivist internalist’s commitment to (esc). We have seen no reason to think that the demand for epistemic self‐consciousness entails a commitment to this particular conception of evidential guidance. When does justification demand the possession and proper use of reasons or evidence? This question concerns the role of reason‐giving in epistemically responsible belief‐ management . This role is more specialized than has generally been recognized: Goldman is right to complain that subjectivist internalism – which is most traditional internalism – vastly overstates the extent to which being justified depends on possessing and making appropriate use of reasons and evidence. In effect, to the question “When, where, and for whom are reasons required, if believing is to count as epistemically responsible?” (esc) answers “Always, everywhere and for everyone.”xii On this view, what Sellars calls “the logical space of reasons” (1997: 76) conforms to what I have called a Prior Grounding Structure (PGS): (PGS) In all epistemic contexts, epistemic assertional entitlement always derives, in whole or in part, from something positive that a claimant has done to earn it. A claimant’s commitment must have been reached by the proper use of evidence, or via some appropriately reliable process, which he knows and can show to be reliable. Commitment to (PGS) drives the Agrippan argument. Given (SPC) it threatens to ensnare us in the Pyrrhonian Problematic. but (PGS) imposes a severe Claimant‐Questioner Asymmetry (CQA)with respect to the right to question and the obligation to respond. INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 15 (CQA) If I represent myself as knowing (or justifiedly believing) that p, there is nothing a questioner has to do, no special position a questioner has to be in, and no way that things have to be, in order for someone to have the right to raise an epistemic question: i.e. to ask me how I know (or why do I believe) that p. The obvious question to ask is why the burdens of epistemic responsibility should be so unevenly distributed? Why isn’t there responsible (and irresponsible) querying as well as responsible (and irresponsible) believing? There is. The structure of permis- sions and obligations imposed by (PGS)/(CQA) is a serious distortion of our ordinary practices of claiming and attributing knowledge, which conform to a Default and Query Structure (DQS): (DQS) In some contexts and with respect to some claims, claimants possess and are properly granted default epistemic assertional entitlement: entitlement that does not depend on the claimant’s doing or having done any specific evidential work or possessing any citable reasons for his commitment. However, default entitlement can lapse. In particular, it can lapse in the face of failure to respond to a contextually appropriate epistemic query. epistemic queries come in two flavors. As Austin remarks, “How do you know?” and “why do you believe?” may be asked out of respectful curiosity, a genuine desire to learn. but they may also be asked pointedly, the implication being that perhaps I don’t know or shouldn’t believe.xiii In the latter case, such queries are challenges to my epistemic authority. In the former my interlocutor only wants an explanation. For example, he may want to know how I found out that p in order to acquire further p‐related information. Here there is no challenge: knowledge is conceded. Nevertheless, queries of both types must be con- textually appropriate and are thus themselves potential objects of epistemic querying. No epistemic query carries an automatic right to an answer. The proper response to a query may be a query. In the case of a challenge, I may need (and thus be entitled) to ask “How do you think I may be going wrong? What do you want to know? If my interlocutor has no response, no concrete challenge has been entered: my epistemic standing remains untouched. The conditions for requesting an explanation may be more liberal, since there is no suggestion of a mistake on the part of the claimant. even so, requests for explanations are not always in order. Suppose that we are both looking into my garden, and my dog wanders past, plainly visible to both of us. Having been wondering where he got to, I say “Oh, there’s the dog.” In these circumstances, your being in a position to concede that I know reflects your already knowing how. As a result, “How do you know?” would fail to ask a serious (or even an intelligible) question. (Or at least, there would need to be a lot more stage‐ setting for it to succeed in doing so.) The upshot is that there is no unfettered right to enter epistemic queries. The claim that merely by representing myself as knowledgeable I stand on the brink of a potentially infinite regress of justification is a myth. It might be thought that everything I have just said is compatible with externalist‐ reliabilism. Indeed, why not take externalist reliabilism, with respect to basic cognitive capacities, as explaining the existence of at least a large class of default entitlements? To 16 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y an extent, I accept this point: much knowledge does arise from the unselfconscious exercise of basic cognitive capacities, and such knowledge often does involve default entitlement. I would go further: much knowledge must have this character. This is because we can only be accountable for our beliefs – can only be epistemic subjects at all – if we routinely get lots of things right in just this way. but this does not mean that we can be austere externalists with respect to this kind of routine knowledge, as Sosa proposes with respect to “animal” knowledge. For as I have argued, even in the case of such routine knowledge, we need more than reliable capacities and procedures: we need some knowledge of how reliable they are. In particular, we need some sense of our limita- tions. We need this knowledge to recognize the appropriateness of epistemic queries and to know how to respond appropriately to them. This knowledge may be largely implicit and practical: not separate from the way we handle epistemic questions but immanent in it. And of course, as Goldman insists, it is subject to empirical correction and expan- sion. This is another point on which we agree. Where we part company is that my account of knowledge  –  fully human knowledge  –  preserves an essential connection between being justified and having the ability to justify. However, being justified requires only being able to justify when required: that is, in the face of a contextually appropriate epistemic query: this is all that epistemic accountability entails. much routine knowl- edge is not seriously or sometimes even intelligibly challengeable, giving it an “external- ist” appearance. However, appearances are misleading. So much for deontology. What about guidance? I have argued that knowledge‐claims are appraisable in two dimensions: responsibility and reliability. Over time, our engage- ment with the world and with each other, in the context of epistemic practices governed by these twin constraints, shapes our beliefs. Suspicions of irresponsibility or unreliability are a potent source of epistemic challenges, thus a spur to belief‐revision. In this way, the constraints of responsibility and reliability play a guiding role. but neither constraint has any essential connection with “guidance” if this is taken to involve constant self‐conscious epistemic monitoring or decision‐making. We should reconsider the knowability constraint that Goldman takes follow from the GD conception of justification. Recall: (KJ) The only facts that qualify as justifiers of an agent’s believing p at time t are facts that the agent can readily know, at t, to obtain or not to obtain. Goldman sees this as a weak knowability constraint. but from my standpoint, it is still far too strong. There is no reason to suppose that, at the time I came to know that p, I had to be in a position to appraise the reliability (general or situational) of the procedure through which I obtained this knowledge. Generally speaking, attending to first‐order matters is incompatible with pursuing epistemic inquiries. A challenge to the reliability of the epistemic procedure on the basis of which I take myself to know that p may trigger a subsequent investigation. my claim to knowledge will be sustained if the challenge can be dealt with at that time. Goldman is right to repudiate the subjectivist internalism that has dominated so much traditional epistemology. but the case for repudiating internalism, understood as INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y 17 demanding both epistemic self‐consciousness and some essential connection between justification and reason‐giving, remains to be made. Notes i Alvin Goldman (1976). Sensitivity, was proposed by Robert Nozick, though not under that name (1981: 172f). Safety is advocated by ernest Sosa and by Duncan Pritchard (Sosa 1999; Pritchard 2002). ii Throughout this chapter, page numbers are given for the 2002 reprint of Goldman’s 1999 article “Internalism exposed” in Pathways to Knowledge, hereafter referred to as PK. iii At least in modern philosophy from Descartes on. It is arguable that reliabilism was antici- pated in Greek philosophy of the Hellenistic period. iv A consequence of our “internalistic” theory of knowledge is that, if one is subject to an episte- mic requirement at any time, then this requirement is imposed by the conscious state in which one happens to find oneself at that time” (Chisholm 1989: 59–60. Quoted by Goldman, PK: 7). v It is better to say that the task of epistemology is to illuminate epistemic concepts: their character, importance, value and role in our lives. The account of justification I sketch in this chapter will indicate why I take this meta‐theoretical position. vi A notable exception is Peter Klein (2007). I discuss Klein’s infinitism in “Avoiding the Regress,” in Peter Klein and John Turri (2014). vii everyday justification appears linear because it is local: the coherence of the system at large is taken for granted (see bonjour 1988). Though bonjour no longer defends coherentism, his book remains a classic of the coherentist literature. The idea that the best coherentist strat- egy involves treating justification as an emergent property of belief systems is illuminatingly stated in Klein (2007). viii mcDowell (1996) offers an extended defense of this conception of the content of perceptual experience. ix I discuss Sosa’s way out of the Pyrrhonian Problematic in “Pyrrhonian skepticism and two kinds of knowledge” (Williams 2011). x Or right to some extent. Reliability is reliability across some appropriate range of situations. Deontic considerations bubble beneath the surface. Ignoring them leads to the notorious Generality Problem. xi That pretensions to knowledge are assessed along these two dimensions—responsibility and reliability—seems to me to be the one useful lesson to learn from the Gettier problem. In a familiar kind of Gettier case, a person comes to a true conclusion in a completely responsible way, though his procedure in (non‐culpably) unreliable, so that his ending up with a true belief is a matter of luck. Such cases are supposed to show that there can be justified true belief with- out knowledge. but I think that we do better to follow Hilary Kornblith and Robert Fogelin, who argue that such a person is justified in a way. He has fulfilled his epistemic obligations, and lacking further information about his situation we would be inclined to attribute knowledge to him. but if we are aware that he has followed a procedure that is in fact unreliable, we will see that there is a way in which he is not justified and withhold the attribution of knowledge, even if (by good luck) he forms a belief that is true (Kornblith 1983; Fogelin 1994: 27f). xii Fogelin calls this extreme evidentialist doctrine “Cliffordism,” as it is the answer given by W. K. Clifford in his famous essay, “The ethics of belief.” See Fogelin 1994, part II for an extended and illuminating critique of epistemology conducted in its shadow. Clifford’s essay can be found in Clifford (1999). xiii Austin 1961: 46. 18 INT e RN A l IS m, R el IA b I l IS m, AND   D e ONT O l OG y References Austin, J.l. (1961) Other minds.

Reply to Michael Williams True to form, michael Williams has advanced a careful and detailed account of my critique of epistemological internalism in “Internalism exposed” (Goldman 1999). He has also sketched an alternative form of internalism, which he sees as preferable to other internal- isms abroad today, and one I have not successfully refuted. I don’t have space to address his full dialectic, but I shall pinpoint some reservations I have about this attempt. The first point concerns the nature of the target analysandum. We are talking about justification, or justifiedness. This is usually regarded as a (normative) property of a belief or the state of a potential believer (vis‐à‐vis a specified proposition). It is a property or state exemplified by a belief or a believer at a given time. To exemplify justifiedness, however, is not to perform any action, or engage in an activity, of justifying. A belief ’s being justified does not consist, for example, in showing or demonstrating the belief to be true. This distinction was originally emphasized by William Alston, and I take contemporary epistemologists to agree that the theory of justification is concerned with the property of justifiedness rather than the action of justifying. I shall return to this in due course. The internalism/externalism dispute is a dispute over the nature of “justifiers,” or “J‐factors,” that is, the states of affairs that help determine a belief ’s justificational status. The two main varieties of internalism, currently in play, are accessibilism and mentalism. Accessibilism says that states or properties are J‐factors only if they are (in some relevant sense) accessible to the agent at the time of belief. mentalism says that states or properties are J‐factors only if they are mental states. externalism rejects both of these constraints on J‐factors. In the paradigmatic cases, being “internal” involves being wholly “within” the mind of the agent – at the time of belief. Thus Chisholm (1989) writes, “[T]he concept of epistemic justification is … internal and immediate – in that one can find out directly, by reflection, what one is justified in believing at any time” (1989, p. 7). 20 R e P l y T O m ICHA el WI ll IA m S my 1999 paper focused on an attempt to pinpoint a satisfactory rationale for internalism, a rationale that implies either accessibilism or mentalism. I formulated what I call the “guidance‐deontological” (GD) conception of justification, intended to rationalize one or another form of internalism. GD is a possible rationale for internalism, because one might claim that an agent cannot so guide her epistemic “conduct” as to do the right thing unless it is accessible to her, or knowable by her what is (epistemically) right. As I pro- ceeded to argue, however, GD is not a sufficiently convincing rationale for internalism (and no other rationale is in the offing). Furthermore, I argue that the kind of constraint implied by internalism, what I call the “direct knowability” constraint, is too stringent a requirement for justifiedness. If that kind of constraint is accepted, many beliefs we commonly accept as justified will not qualify as such. For example, someone who originally acquired a belief that eating broccoli is healthful from a reliable source – and was therefore justified – continues to retain her justifiedness even if she no longer retains a memory of her justification‐originating source. but the direct knowability requirement won’t allow this, because she lacks direct knowability to this past event. This, among several other examples, is key to my attempted “refutation” of internalism. Williams appears to agree with many of my arguments to this point, but then he initiates maneuvers that I don’t follow. First, he introduces the idea of “subjectivist” internalism, and implies that I (wrongly) restrict internalism to this kind of internalism. I don’t understand exactly what Williams means by “subjectivist” internalism and don’t think that my case against internalism hinges on such a notion (above and beyond plain internalism as already explained, in terms of either accessibilism or mentalism). Williams wants to defend a non‐subjectivist kind of internalism, different from the form of inter- nalism I have been seeking to undercut, and he denies that my arguments succeed in undercutting it. To motivate this (non‐subjectivist) variety of internalism he introduces a number of considerations rather foreign to my discussion and (more importantly) foreign to what I take to be the central contemporary conception of internalism, as defended, for example, by bonJour or Feldman and Conee. Here is a passage in which he begins to “add” to the requirements for internalism: [T]o be an epistemic subject is to be accountable for one’s beliefs… Accountable beings must … have the capacity to account for themselves: that is … must be capable of establishing or defending such entitlement. This is followed by several related requirements: being justified in one’s beliefs must have an essential connection with the practice of justifying them. being justified will involve the capacity to explain how and why one believes as one does… Since vindicating a claim to knowledge often involves giving one’s credentials – for example, appealing to the reliability of one’s recognitional capacities  –  epistemic subjects must not only possess reliable cognitive capacities, they must know something about how reliable those capacities are. R e P l y T O m ICHA el WI ll IA m S 21 A pivotal point embedded in Williams’s approach is that being justified involves the capacity to explain why one believes as one does and to be able to vindicate a claim to knowledge. In short, being justified implies the ability to justify believing as one does – apparently, justify to others – by knowing (and showing?) how reliable one’s capac- ities are. This is precisely the sort of separate or “extra” activity that I said at the beginning of this reply is nowadays acknowledged to be distinct and additional to the first‐order state of justifiedness. It could qualify as what Alston (1980) has called a “level‐confusion.” It involves both requirements of “meta‐knowledge” about one’s justificational state as well as a communicational ability with respect to others that isn’t inherent in justifiedness per se. (even verbally challenged or dialectically unskilled agents can have well‐justified beliefs, for example, perceptual beliefs.) So I have a hard time seeing how it is supposed to advance the cause of internalism. In fact, it increases the difficulties for an internalism that seeks to avoid skepticism. So why should internalists accept it, much less externalists? References Alston, W. (1980) level‐confusions in epistemology. In: French, P., Uehling, T. and Wettstein, H.

Goldman against Internalism L auren ce Bo nJ our 2 In addition to being the most important proponent of the main externalist view of epistemic justification, reliabilism, Alvin Goldman has over the years been perhaps the most persistent critic of internalist views. His most extensive recent discussions of inter- nalism are contained in two major papers, published almost exactly ten years apart. Both the differences and the similarities between these two papers are striking. In the earlier paper, “Internalism exposed” (Goldman 1999; hereafter IE), Goldman attempts, via a series of problems and objections, to offer a conclusive demolition of internalist accounts of epistemic justification. His sweeping conclusion, in the final sentence of the paper, is: “So I see no hope for internalism; it does not survive the glare of the spotlight” (293). It is thus rather surprising that early on in the second paper, “Internalism, Externalism, and the Architecture of Justification” (Goldman 2009; hereafter IEAJ), Goldman tells us that he “originally planned to develop a hybrid position, one that would espouse a synthesis, or blend, of internalism and externalism” (315). In this paper, he is also, at least on the surface, rather gentler in his treatment of internalism, in particular by adopting a “major- itarian configuration” of the “terms of engagement” between internalism and external- ism, according to which internalism would “win” if even a majority of the factors relevant to justificational status (“J‐factors”) were internalist in character (310). (It will, I suppose, be obvious to almost anyone familiar with the debate and with the rationale for internal- ism that such a “victory” would, despite Goldman’s surface generosity, amount to a total defeat for internalism.) Despite these contrasts, the arguments against internalism that appear in the two papers are quite similar, falling mostly into three main clusters concerned with the follow- ing three issues: (1) whether internalism can give an adequate account of the logical and probabilistic relations involved in justification; (2) whether internalism can give an G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 23 account of the role of epistemic principles (“J‐rules” in IEAJ) in justification; and (3) whether internalism can give an adequate account of memory, particularly of so‐called “preservative memory.” though the details vary somewhat between the two papers, Goldman seems to still regard the resulting objections to internalism as utterly decisive. my own view, in contrast, is that Goldman’s objections have very little force—and that what force they might seem initially to have derives largely from serious misunderstand- ings of the internalist view. I believe that this is extremely obvious for the arguments pertaining to issue (1) and nearly as clear for those pertaining to issue (2). Issue (3), on the other hand, is more difficult, though the objections are still far from compelling; but the most crucial point is that it is doubtful that Goldman’s reliabilist version of externalism has any advantage over internalism in this area. one main aim of the present chapter is to elaborate and support these assessments. this is my second attempt to come to grips with Goldman’s arguments in IE. In an earlier paper (BonJour 2001), I discussed many of them and also offered some criticisms of Goldman’s account of the rationale for internalism. But I erred in that paper by taking the basic idea of internalism to be relatively obvious and so did not take seriously enough the misunderstandings of it that now seem to me obvious in both that paper and the later one. the result was a rather spectacular absence of any meeting of minds between myself and Goldman: in his reply (Goldman 2001), he in effect accuses me of adopting a new and mistaken conception of internalism, “a new kind of hybrid view” that isn’t really an inter- nalist view at all (464). this, of course, is not what I thought I was doing, and it is surely rather unlikely that (despite being standardly cited as one of the main proponents of the view) I was so confused about internalism as to abandon it inadvertently. In fact, I still believe that everything in BonJour 2001 reflects a very standard conception of internalism, the one often referred to as “access internalism.” I also, with one exception noted below, still regard everything in that paper as correct in relation to the specific issues discussed.i Here, however, I propose to approach the issues largely afresh, focusing far more explic- itly this time on just what internalism (in my view) amounts to. As it happens, the issue about the nature of internalism has been importantly sharpened by the appearance (more or less simultaneously with my earlier paper and Goldman’s reply) of another internalist critique of Goldman by Earl Conee and richard Feldman (Conee and Feldman 2001). In addition to discussing some but not all of the arguments in IE, Conee and Feldman (here- after, for brevity, “C&F”) also contrast two different accounts of internalism, making what I regard as an unfortunate choice between them, one that invites some of Goldman’s misconceptions. thus their views can serve as a useful foil for my own, and I will devote part of the paper to a consideration of them. the following discussion is divided into four main sections. In the first and longest, I offer my preferred account of internalism and its basic rationale, contrasting it with the one adopted by C&F and then with the ones that Goldman suggests in these two papers. the following two sections discuss the supposed problems pertaining to logical and prob- abilistic relations and to epistemic principles, arguing that they have no real force and mostly result from misunderstandings of the internalist view. the final section will then consider the only problem that seems to me even initially troublesome, what Goldman 24 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m refers to in IE as “the problem of forgotten evidence” and in IEAJ as the problem of “preservative memory,” arguing both that there are adequate, albeit not entirely unprob- lematic internalist responses available; and also that one of the standard problems for externalism is especially conspicuous here, enough to prevent this problem from count- ing in favor of externalism to any serious degree. (there are also some further objections or at least brief stabs at objections contained in these papers; virtually all of these are addressed, though usually without making this explicit, in the discussion of the nature of internalism.) 1 What is internalism? 1.1 Access internalism In my book The Structure of Empirical Knowledge (BonJour 1985), having made the point that the basic role of epistemic justification is that of a means to truth, I elaborate as follows: the distinguishing characteristic of epistemic justification is thus its essential or internal relation to the cognitive goal of truth. It follows that one’s cognitive endeavors are epistemically justified only if and to the extent that they are aimed at this goal, which means very roughly that one accepts all and only those beliefs that one has good reason to think are true. (8) In a later discussion (BonJour 1992), I characterize the idea of internalism in the following way: … a theory of justification is internalist only if it requires that all of the factors needed for a belief to be epistemically justified for a given person be cognitively accessible to that person, internal to his cognitive perspective … (132) A bit later on, having raised the issue of what sort of accessibility is required, I say that “the main intuitive motivation for internalism” is “the idea that epistemic justification requires that the believer actually have in his cognitive possession a reason for thinking that the belief is true,” where this contrasts with a reason that could be arrived at by further investigation or even just further reflection (133) – and even more with one that is available only from an external, third‐person perspective. As these passages (along with many others that could be cited) make clear, my funda- mental view has always been that epistemic justification requires that there be a good reason for thinking that the belief in question is true; and that what makes an account of such justification internalist is the requirement that the reason in question be a reason that the believer already has: not one that is entirely beyond his (or her – an amplification that I mean to be understood throughout) ken, but also not merely one that he could come to discover – even if that discovery requires only further reflection on cognitive materials that are already available to him. A readily discoverable reason is in one sense accessible, but it is still not a reason that the person currently has. (With this understanding, I will continue to use the useful term “access.”) G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 25 In contrast, the definitive characteristic of an externalist view is that although there is still a reason or what could be a reason for thinking that the belief is true, this reason is not one that the believer has, because, in the most standard sort of case, one or more of the essential elements of the reason is external to his conception of the situation, beyond his ken. thus in my by now familiar example of norman the reliable clairvoyant (BonJour 1985, 41–5), norman has no idea that that the way in which he arrives at his beliefs is in fact reliable; one who knew that would have a reason to think that norman’s clairvoyant beliefs are true, but that reason is not available to norman. though this basic idea still seems to me both clear and obvious, some further comments may help to ward off potential misunderstandings: First. though the person must currently have the reason in order to be internalisti- cally justified by my lights, I see no reason that this should require that he actually have it in mind, completely or even partially, at the moment in question, nor even that he be capable of having it completely in mind at any one moment. A reason, and the elements that it relies on, may be stored in memory and still be a reason that one has: one that can be recalled without making any new discovery. And even a reason that is too complicated to hold in mind at an instant, but must instead be collated and reviewed over a period of time, can still be a reason that the person has, not one that needs to be discovered. Here as elsewhere, what is crucial is to preserve the clear contrast with externalism: what is true of norman is not that he can only recall and formulate a reason over time, but rather that he has no accessible reason at all, not even of this sort. (Here a somewhat ad hominem exam- ple may help by way of illustration. It seems clear that Goldman himself, at the times when he finished each of the papers under discussion, thought that he had a strong reason to think that internalism is mistaken or inadequate. But despite my great respect for his intellectual prowess, it seems overwhelmingly clear that even Goldman could not have had the argument of either paper, or even any substantial chunk of those arguments, entirely in mind at an instant.) Second. What I intend by a reason is any ground or basis in virtue of which the belief in question is likely to be true, with the strength of the justification varying with the strength of this likelihood. I make no assumption here as to what form this basis or ground might take, and in particular do not assume that it must be wholly or even partly proposi- tional in form. But I do insist that it be a complete reason, one that is enough by itself to yield such likelihood of truth. thus, for example, being aware of a sensory experience of the right sort would not constitute a reason for a belief about a physical object unless accompanied by a (justified) belief or insight that the occurrence of such an experience makes it likely that such an object is present. (there can also be reasons that support other doxastic attitudes, such as withholding, rejection, degrees of confidence, and so on, and also reasons that defeat other reasons, but I will ignore these further complications here.) third. reiterating a bit, what makes this conception of justification internalist is the requirement that the reason in question must be one that the person actually has, and so must involve only elements that are internal to his cognitive perspective. the main con- trast is with views according to which some or all of the essential aspects of the reason are external to the person’s cognitive perspective, inaccessible to him (even though perhaps accessible to some external observer). thus while the person’s access to such a reason and 26 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m its components obviously involves mental states, occurrent or dispositional, there is no immediate implication that the elements of the reason must themselves be exclusively or even partially mental in character. It is enormously plausible that many (but probably not all) features of most (but probably not all) mental states are in fact accessible in the rele- vant way to the person who has them, with no need for any further justification, and this makes such features of such states eligible to play a role in an internalist justification. But this justificatory role of mental states is a further, albeit enormously plausible result, not an immediate consequence of the basic internalist conception itself. moreover, as elabo- rated further below, there is no apparent basis for thinking that only mental states and their features are accessible in the right way, so that all of the elements of internalist rea- sons would have to be mental. (As we will see, this is the fundamental problem both with C&F’s “mentalism” and with many of Goldman’s attempts to formulate internalism.) Fourth. one way for the elements of a reason to be cognitively accessible is for the belief or awareness that they obtain to be justified by something further. thus as inquiry and reflection progress, further elements and so further reasons become available. If, for example, we can have justified beliefs about laws of nature, then facts about such laws can themselves be elements in further internalistically accessible reasons. this is important, because it means that from an access internalist standpoint, it is a mistake to simply char- acterize a certain sort of factor or element as externalist in character (as Goldman often does). Any factor or element  –  even the sort of reliability that plays a central role in Goldman’s own view – can qualify as a part of an internalist reason if (but only if) the person in question has cognitive access to it. Fifth. But, as the familiar epistemic regress problem shows, not all justifying ele- ments can be available only by virtue of further justifications of this sort. thus on any internalist view, some reasons and the elements that they involve must be immediately (or directly) available, available without justificatory reliance on anything else. As just noticed, it is highly plausible that many features of many mental states have this status, and this is a further reason why mental states are likely to be central to any plausible version of internalism. But it again does not follow that only mental states and their features have this status.ii What is the rationale for the internalist view that I have been describing? In IE, Goldman suggests as the main rationale for internalism a two‐element conception that he calls the “guidance‐deontological (GD) conception of justification” (Goldman 1999, 272 ff.). Here the “guidance” element is the idea that the role of justification is to guide people in deciding what to believe, in which case it must be accessible to the person making such a decision. And the deontological element is the idea that what is fundamen- tal to justification is satisfying one’s epistemic duties and avoiding epistemic irresponsi- bility. But while both of these ideas have undeniably played roles in internalist thought, neither is, I believe, nearly as central as Goldman suggests. Instead, the central rationale for internalism derives from perhaps the most central and obvious epistemological ques- tion: whether a person has, from his own standpoint, any good reason to think that any of the various beliefs he holds are true or even likely to be true. this was the central question for Descartes and locke and so many others. And any attempt to answer it without presupposing claims or facts about which the issue of justification is not in turn raised G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 27 leads more or less directly to the internalist view I have been describing. raising this fundamental issue obviously need not involve any supposition that what one believes is subject to voluntary decision or control. And while it is very natural to describe seeking such reasons as satisfying an epistemic duty or being epistemically responsible, this is a secondary characterization and in no way essential to either the basic epistemological issue or the internalist character of the possible answers. obviously much more could be said about all of this, but perhaps this will suffice for present purposes. I turn now to a comparison of this account of internalism with the one proposed by C&F. 1.2 Against mentalism In their paper “Internalism defended” (Conee and Feldman 2001), C&F begin by discussing two different accounts of what internalism is. they briefly consider “accessi- bilism,” which on their account says that all of the “factors that determine whether a belief is justified” (for which they adopt Goldman’s term “J‐factors”) must be accessible to the person in question, but opt instead for a view they call “mentalism,” of which they offer two rather different formulations. on the first, mentalism says that “a person’s beliefs are justified only by things that are internal to the person’s mental life,” where these may include both occurrent and dispositional mental states (55).iii the second, “more precise” formulation of mentalism is a supervenience thesis: the justificatory status of a person’s doxastic attitudes strongly supervenes on the person’s occurrent and dispositional mental states, events, and conditions. (56) In fact, these two formulations of mentalism are far from obviously equivalent. If we assume that “J‐factors” have that status because of the roles they play in reasons that make the belief in question likely to be true – something that there is no reason to think that C&F would oppose, though they say little about reasons specifically  –  then the first formulation says that only mental states can serve as elements in such reasons, while the second says only that what reasons one has cannot vary independently of one’s mental states. the second formulation is a substantially weaker and less specific claim, in a way that will become clearer as we proceed. For the moment, I will focus on the first of these two formulations of mentalism. my claim will be that mentalism, thus understood, is highly misleading and unperspicuous at best and quite likely substantively mistaken. the first question to ask is what the rationale for mentalism, if viewed as a genuine alternative to the access version of internalism discussed above, is supposed to be. Why (from a recognizably internalist standpoint) are mental states, and only mental states, sup- posed to have this crucial epistemic status? We have already seen that on the access view, it is plausible that most properties of most mental states will be eligible to serve as elements of justifying reasons because they are in fact accessible to the believer in the right way. But from this point it does not follow that only mental states can play this role, as mentalism claims (nor that all mental states can do so). And if this is the main rationale 28 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m for mentalism, then mentalism is really only a less perspicuous version of access internalism and not a genuine alternative. C&F say that they opt for mentalism on grounds of “simplicity and clarity” (56). they do not elaborate further, but one can perhaps conjecture that it is the notion of access that is supposed to be insufficiently clear. iv I do not think that there is any serious unclarity in the notion of access, but even if there were, this would not in itself constitute an inde- pendent rationale for mentalism. Here I can only say I can find no such rationale, either in C&F’s discussion or anywhere else, not even a suggestion of one that is worth consider- ing. my strong suspicion is that it is only the direct accessibility of (at least many) mental states and their properties that gives them any special epistemological status. And if this is so, then any problems there might be with the notion of access would count just as much against mentalism. the issue of whether there is any independent rationale for mentalism may be illumined further by considering the question of whether all mental states and properties qualify as “J‐factors.” mentalism is not committed to this stronger thesis. But if, as I will try to show, it is very plausible that not all mental states and properties have this status, the mentalist surely owes us an explanation of why this is so. If it is mentality and nothing else that makes something a “J‐factor,” then why do some mental states fail to qualify? my suggestion will be that the only plausible answer to this question appeals again to the idea of access. Here is a list of some kinds of mental states and properties of mental states that it is plausible to suppose cannot serve as “J‐factors,” that is as elements of justifying reasons, for a person at a particular time: 1 Unconscious mental states, of the sorts alleged to exist by Freudian views and others. 2 mental states that occurred at some earlier time and have now been entirely forgotten. 3 Features of particular mental states that are too complicated for the person to reflec- tively grasp. (one example of this sort is the famous case of the speckled hen.) 4 Global features of one’s current mental states that are too complicated to be reflec- tively grasped even over time, such as, perhaps, the coherence of a complicated system of beliefs. v In all of these cases, it is plausible that the mental states or properties in question cannot serve as “J‐factors” for the person in question. this is at least initially puzzling if it is simply the status of being mental that makes something eligible to play such a justificatory role. And if, as seems clear, the reason in each case is that the person does not have cogni- tive access to the state or property in question, then such cases show that it is accessibility rather than mentality as such that is epistemologically significant. the discussion so far suggests that mentalism is at best no more than an unperspicu- ous and misleading way to formulate the access view. But there are also reasons for think- ing that mentalism is substantively mistaken in claiming that only mental states and properties can play a justificatory role: First, C&F discuss two contrasting cases of testimony, which differ in that the recipi- ent of the testimony in one case lacks and in the other case possesses substantial evidence G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 29 of the honesty and integrity of the testifier. they claim, plausibly enough, that the belief that the receiver acquires by accepting the testimony is strongly justified in the latter case and much less so (they say not at all) in the former case (59). Here the most natural account of the second case would surely be that the recipient has a good reason to think that the claim in question is true, with one main element of that reason being the honesty and integrity of the testifier. But, obviously, the honesty and integrity of the testifier are not mental states of the recipient. What C&F say is that the testifier’s integrity and honesty have been “internalized” in the second case by being “suitably brought into” the recipient’s mind [59]. But, of course, the testifier’s honesty and integrity are not literally brought into the recipient’s mind. What happens instead is that the recipient comes to have cognitive access to them by virtue of his evidence. Access internalism allows for a more natural account in which different sorts of elements can play a role in reasons at different levels, with only the most ultimate reasons being restricted to elements, such as mental states, that are immediately accessible. And of course there are many other examples about which analogous things could be said. Second, moreover, there is a further, much more important issue that raises an analo- gous problem: the issue of how to understand the role of logical and probabilistic rela- tions, or necessary truths generally, in justification. there are many, many cases of apparently internalist justification in which it is intuitively plausible to regard truths of this kind as among the essential elements of the justifying reason, and internalists have standardly taken (at least many) such truths to be among the things to which one has internalist access. this access undeniably involves mental states, usually characterized as states of a priori intuition or a priori insight, which yield a priori justification and knowl- edge. I can see no reason for thinking that C&F mean to dispute any of this. But can the internalist reason for an a priori justified claim be understood as appealing only to those mental states as “J‐factors” – that is, I take it, as elements of the justifying reason? How is the supposed a priori truth supposed to be established by such a purely mental reason? Any further added premise would either have to be itself justified a priori, raising the same issue all over again, or else justified empirically, which would apparently destroy the supposed a priori status of the original claim. my alternative suggestion is that the most basic cases of a priori justification should be viewed as involving fundamentally relational states in which the necessity, and so the truth, of the claims in question is immediately apprehended. on such a view, while mental states of a priori insight play an essential role in the justification, it is a mistake to think that the reason for an a priori claim can be adequately captured in terms of such a mental state alone. I have no space here to adequately elaborate and defend this alternative picture.vi my present point is that C&F’s adoption of mentalism seems to rule it out on the basis of no discernible argument and to commit them to an alternative that is certainly not adequately spelled out and may well not be tenable. the closest that C&F come to a consideration of this issue is their discussion of the con- trast between what is justified for a “logic tA” who can “easily tell through simple reflec- tion” that “certain propositions validly follow” from an accepted premise and a “beginning logic student” who has no insight of this sort. the logic tA is thereby justified in accepting these further claims, while the beginning student is not (60). they in effect concede that 30 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m what makes the epistemic difference here is the external (that is, non‐mental) fact that certain “necessary truths of logic” hold. But they claim that the tA’s “cognizance” of these truths in effect “internalizes” them in a way that makes the appeal to them compatible with mentalism. And, as with the testimony case, it is hard to make clear sense of this view and much easier to interpret the case (as indeed some of their language suggests) as one in which the tA immediately apprehends and so has access to logical facts that remain in themselves non‐mental. (It is worth noting that the problem posed by these cases does not arise for the second, supervenience conception of mentalism. Even if a priori justification cannot be adequately understood as appealing only to mental states as reasons, the required state of rational intuition or insight is still a mental state, as is the awareness of the evidence in the testimony case, and this is enough to make the supervenience thesis hold. But this, I submit, only shows how relatively vague and unhelpful the supervenience conception is.) For all these reasons, I regard mentalism as an unfortunate choice, one that fails to capture the main internalist view in a clear way. I will conclude this part of the chapter with a quick look at Goldman’s own characterizations of internalism, which lean heavily in the direction of mentalism. 1.3 Goldman’s accounts of internalism In both of the papers under consideration here, Goldman attempts to formulate the inter- nalist view in order to provide a target for the criticisms he wants to make. Especially in IE, the discussions leading up to these formulations are too complicated and convoluted to give a full account of them here. But in both papers, the main target that emerges is essentially mentalism, though with the two versions discussed above not very clearly dis- tinguished. though there are gestures here and there at the idea of access, nothing very close to the access internalist position outlined above ever emerges at all clearly. this will be clearer after we have looked at the specific arguments, especially those pertaining to the a priori. But a brief discussion of the main formulations of internalism in the two papers will help to set the stage. In IE, Goldman begins with the “guidance‐deontological” conception of the rationale for internalism already discussed above. this is in turn used to motivate “the knowability constraint on justifiers”: the only facts that qualify as justifiers of an agent’s believing p at time t are facts that the agent can readily know, at t, to obtain or not to obtain. (274) this at least resembles the idea of access discussed above. But the idea that these “justifiers” have that status because of the role they play in reasons is not made clear; and, more cru- cially, the requirement of being “readily” knowable fails to distinguish between elements and resulting reasons that a person already has and those that could be easily discovered. Goldman then adds, though with no real explanation beyond two brief quotations from Ginet and Chisholm, the idea that this ready knowability must be direct. He then remarks that “at least one mode of direct knowledge is introspection”; and then, aided G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 31 only by a quotation from Chisholm that really only expresses the supervenience version of mentalism, proceeds to a formulation according to which only facts that can be known by introspection can be justifiers – that is, as I would prefer to put it, can play a role in internalist reasons (277). Since, more or less by definition, only mental states can be known in this way, this is mentalism, though with the added problem that Goldman takes the result of introspection to be limited to current conscious states, a restriction that almost no internalist, with the possible exception at times of C&F, would accept. In the face of problems, which are not hard to find, this very restrictive account is eventually loosened to allow stored mental states retrievable through memory and also the results of certain “computational operations” to count as justifiers (279, 285). But these additions are not treated as corrections to the initial account for which there is a clear epistemic rationale, but rather as more or less ad hoc concessions to the internalist for which there is no rationale beyond trying to evade difficulties. there is no hint of any recognition on Goldman’s part that his original conception of internalism might simply have been mistaken, at least in relation to one main version of the internalist view. (Surely he should have noticed that Chisholm, in the book from which two of the quotations lead- ing to his mentalist formulation are taken, devotes a whole chapter to the idea that many necessary truths are also directly or immediately knowable (Chisholm 1989: ch. 4).) With C&F’s discussion to guide him, Goldman’s accounts of internalism in IEAJ are more straightforward. A view that at least resembles access internalism is formulated, though without highlighting the role of reasons and with a requirement of direct accessi- bility that is scare‐quoted but not explained. And a version of mentalism is also offered, one that is essentially the same as the first of C&F’s formulations, as discussed above (though the supervenience version is also invoked at times, with no recognition that it is distinct). And in the further discussion of supposed problems, it is again mentalism that Goldman clearly has mainly in mind, though some brief gestures are also made toward his version of the access view. though clarity will require some reference to Goldman’s accounts of internalism, my main concern for the rest of the chapter will be whether and to what extent Goldman’s arguments are effective against the access version of internalism described above, which I take to be the main internalist view (though it would be enough if it were one main inter- nalist view). I will also largely ignore the already mentioned suggestion in IEAJ that the issue between internalism and externalism has to do with the relative numbers of J‐factors that are internalist or externalist in character. By now it should be clear that the version of internalism I am advocating requires that all of the elements needed for a complete reason be internalistically accessible, and I will mainly construe the arguments to be considered as attempts to show that that this is not so. 2 Logical and Probabilistic Relations As already briefly indicated, one major component of Goldman’s anti‐internalist argu- ment in both of the papers under discussion is the thesis that internalism cannot account for the role of “logical and probabilistic relations” (IE 282) or relations “of deductive, 32 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m inductive, or abductive support” (IEAJ 316) in justification. What seems to be at issue here is any sort of necessary truth or principle of inference that would underwrite a rela- tion of justificatory support between mental states such as beliefs and experiences and further propositional claims (such as claims about the extra‐mental world). In both papers, Goldman points out, correctly, that standard versions of internalism seem to appeal to relations of this sort as part of the basis for internalist justification. In IE, the main argument that relations of the sort in question are not legitimately available from an internalist standpoint could hardly be simpler: having in effect identi- fied internalism with mentalism, Goldman merely points out that relations of this kind are not mental states. (In that paper, he proceeds to grant to the internalist a kind of access to such relations on an essentially ad hoc basis and then raises some further, more specific problems that will be briefly discussed below.) In IEAJ, the argument is slightly more complicated. Goldman first makes again the obvious point that such a relation (or the fact that it holds) is not a mental state and so not internal according to mentalism. He then invokes the (largely unexplained) “accessibilist” view, and argues that many relations of the intended type … are not directly accessible to most epistemic agents. Extremely complex entailment relations, holding between a huge set of complex premises and a conclusion, will not be “directly recognizable,” or recognizable at all, for most epis- temic agents. (317) nothing is said about how pervasive cases of this sort are or about whether there are plau- sible cases of justification for which those relations that are not directly recognizable are clearly needed. What is flagrantly absent in both papers is any consideration or even any clear recogni- tion of the view that it is a priori insight or intuition that gives us cognitive access to many (though not all) relations of this kind and allows them to be elements in internalist justifi- cations. Such a view has been a central ingredient of all, or virtually all, internalist posi- tions, from Descartes and locke down to Chisholm and many, many others. Even C&F seem in several places to recognize it, though without realizing that it is only dubiously compatible with their mentalism. I am, of course, not saying that such a view of a priori justification and its application to truths or relations of the sort that Goldman is concerned with is clearly correct or beyond any criticism (though I believe that it is correct and have defended it at length in BonJour 1998). Goldman might want to object in a general way to such a view, or he might want to argue (as the passage just quoted perhaps suggests) that it does not plausibly account for all of the logical and probabilistic facts needed to account for the full range of beliefs that seem intuitively to be justified. But he makes no real effort to do either of these things in the papers under discussion here (nor anywhere else, to my knowledge), and it seems plausible that at least one main part of the explanation for this is Goldman’s over- whelming focus on mentalism and his failure to take access internalism at all seriously. But however this may be, it seems clear that the argument he actually gives has no real force at all against an access internalist position. G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 33 As noted already, in IE Goldman provisionally grants to the internalist a limited sort of access to necessary truths and then proceeds to raise further difficulties on that basis. the idea is that the mental states accessible by introspection and memory retrieval are to be supplemented by the results of some specified set of “computational operations or algorithms” (283). In addition to the problem of how and on what basis such a set of “computational operations” is to be specified, this also raises the further problems (a) of how long the agent is allowed to use these operations (283–4) and (b) of whether any such set of operations is genuinely available to all of the relevant epistemic agents (285–6). All of this is very artificial and very far from any actual internalist view. But it needs to be asked, at least briefly, whether these supposed problems create any difficulty for the access internalist’s appeal to a priori access to necessary truths. It seems clear that they do not. Setting aside serious doubts as to whether only compu- tational or algorithmic procedures are relevant, the access internalist view is that any claim for which a given epistemic agent has (adequate) a priori justification is thereby eligible to serve as an element in justifying reasons for that agent. If further reflection yields a priori justification for additional claims, then these too become eligible. And if one person’s a priori capacities yield such justification for claims for which a second person lacks such justification (as is obviously often the case), then those claims can serve as elements in justifying reasons for the former person, but not for the latter. All of this seems entirely obvious and unproblematic, so that no difficulty for access internalism emerges here either. (See BonJour 2001 for a somewhat more extensive discussion of this last set of issues.) 3 Epistemic Principles (“J‐rules”) the second main component of Goldman’s case against internalism concerns epistemic principles (as they are referred to in IE) or “right J‐rules” (as they are referred to in IEAJ). As a general characterization, these are general principles that say that a person is justified in accepting such‐and‐such a belief when such‐and‐such conditions are satisfied. these are the sorts of principles or rules that might result from explicitly epistemological investigation. Goldman’s basic argument is (a) that such principles are among the “J‐factors” that determine whether beliefs are justified; and (b) that they do not properly count as internalist factors. As already indicated, I propose to approach this issue from the standpoint of the access internalism described earlier. I think that Goldman is right that ordinary believers and even epistemologists do not in general have cognitive access to such rules or principles. But he does not, in my judgment, make a good case that access to them is required for justification. I will first look at the discussion in IE, which is substantially simpler and more straight- forward. oddly enough, given the rest of his discussion, Goldman here focuses mainly on access, rather than just making the simple point that such a principle or a rule (or what- ever makes it correct) is obviously not a mental state of the believer. Goldman takes access to epistemic principles to be required because they “are among the items that determine whether or not an agent is justified in believing a proposition” (287). He notes Chisholm’s claim that such principles are known a priori, and then proceeds to argue that it is very 34 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m implausible that ordinary epistemic agents can know such principles in this way or indeed in any other. As he points out, even trained epistemologists often, or perhaps always, fail in the attempt to do this (287–8). the discussion in IEAJ is a bit more complicated, partly because it is formulated in relation to Goldman’s by now familiar, but also to my mind rather artificial “right‐rule architecture of epistemic justification” (313–14). But the basic argument is again simple enough. According to this view, beliefs are justified by virtue of correctly instantiating some “right‐rule,” and this makes “the content and rightness of that J‐rule” “positively relevant” to justification and so a “J‐factor” (332). Here Goldman does make the obvious point that the “rightness” of such a rule is not a mental state or somehow reducible to such states. He then proceeds to argue that ordinary people do not have access to such matters – that they “have no clue” as to which such rules are right. vii As already indicated, I think that Goldman is correct that ordinary epistemic agents do not in general have access to all of the epistemic principles or “right J‐rules” that are positively relevant to the justification of their beliefs. the issue is whether they need to have such access in order for their beliefs to be justified according to the access internalist account. to recall, the access internalist view is that what justification requires is that the believer have a good reason for thinking that the belief in question is true. Such a reason must be complete in the sense that enough elements are included for truth to be genuinely likely in relation to them. thus, for example, a reason that relies on a modus ponens argu- ment must include both of the needed premises, not just one of them. moreover, the believer must genuinely have this justification, where this requires that he actually realize that the conclusion indeed follows from those premises (and also that the premise beliefs themselves be justified for him). Such a realization may no doubt be more or less fully explicit, and this perhaps affects the strength of the resulting justification. But to insist, as Goldman in effect does, that the believer must have access to every- thing that is in any way “positively or negatively relevant” to such a reason and its cogency is to go much too far. Even in relation to the very simple schematic example just given, it would be very hard to even complete a list of the things that are thus relevant: the logical principle of modus ponens, a “J‐rule” that embodies this principle, the consistency of a logic that includes this principle, the mistakenness of indefinitely many contrary logics, the truth of the principle of non‐contradiction, etc., etc., more or less without limit. It is, I submit, simply not plausible that a person who does not have access to all of these things thereby fails to have a reason, indeed a good reason, in the imagined case. Focusing more narrowly on epistemic principles (or “J‐rules”), my contrary sugges- tion would be that having a good reason for a belief never need involve having access to such things. People had good reasons for beliefs before there were epistemologists, before anyone ever dreamed of such a subject. Epistemology, like most or all parts of philosophy, arises from reflection on things that exist antecedently, and this is just as true for good reasons for beliefs as for anything else. Such principles are, I suggest, best viewed as attempts to formulate in a more abstract way what makes various reasons good ones, something that could hardly be done if a reason could only be grasped as good in relation to such a principle. of course, that a given set of rules does this correctly is “positively G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 35 relevant” to the goodness of the reasons that it captures and to the justification that they yield: if those rules were not correct, then some of those reasons would probably not be good after all. But this does not show that having such a reason requires access to the results of this essentially second‐order, reflective activity. viii For this reason, Goldman’s appeal to epistemic principles seems to me to constitute no real objection to access internalism. 4 Preservative memory I turn finally to the most challenging of the problems that Goldman discusses, namely certain problems pertaining to memory. Here Goldman’s discussion is focused mainly on examples in relation to which he claims that an internalist view does not produce an intu- itively satisfactory result. I will start with the examples offered in IE, which raise most of the main issues, and then turn to those in IEAJ. Here is the first and most important: (Sally 1) Sally read an account of the health benefits of eating broccoli in the New York Times (assumed to be an extremely reliable source), and on that basis alone justifiably formed the belief that eating broccoli is conducive to good health. She currently retains this belief, but has entirely forgotten the source and has encountered no other evidence either pro or con. (IE 280) Goldman’s view is that Sally’s current belief is still justified. Indeed, since he claims that the current belief qualifies as knowledge if it is true, his view seems to be that the current belief is justified to the same degree as it was when originally formed. He also presumably thinks that his own reliabilist view yields this result and proceeds to argue that internalist views do not. All of these claims seem to me highly questionable. Approaching the issue from an access internalist point of view, Sally’s present belief may well be justified, though probably not to the same degree as her original one (and possibly not at all). What reasons might Sally have for thinking that her current belief is true? there are a number of possibilitiesix: 1 Sally may justifiably believe that most of the things that she recalls in this way turn out, when checked further, to be true, where her evidence for this will be further memories of such successful checking (and the absence of very many remembered cases where the belief turned out to be false), together with further justified beliefs about her own intellectual character and the resulting care with which she evaluates the sources she encounters. 2 the belief in question may have a distinctive phenomenological character, and Sally may again have substantial further evidence both that her beliefs that have this specific phenomenological character were indeed derived from reputable sources and are mostly true. (C&F describe this as “vivacity” and “an associated feeling of confi- dence,” but this seems too simple to do justice to the phenomenon in question.) I do 36 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m not have space here for a detailed discussion of the phenomenology of memory, but it seems plausible to me that we are often able to judge, with what seems upon investiga- tion to be good accuracy, which beliefs came from really solid sources and which not, which are being recalled clearly and which are less sure, which beliefs have been corroborated by other sources and which not, and so on. 3 Sally may have other justified background beliefs that tend to corroborate this one (such as beliefs about the health‐conduciveness of vegetables in general, beliefs about particular ingredients (such as fiber) that broccoli is likely to contain, etc.) She may also fail to have any beliefs that undermine the belief in question. (Goldman may mean to exclude the first part of this possibility when he says that Sally has encoun- tered no corroborating evidence, but excluding all such evidence would make the case rather unlikely and would also, I submit, substantially weaken any intuition that Sally is indeed justified.) 4 Sally’s belief may come with other associated details about the ways in which broccoli supports health that both serve to corroborate it and also make it more likely that she is accurately remembering a source that provided supporting detail and thus was more likely to be reliable. of course much more could and should be said about each of these alternatives. If some or all of these possibilities are realized, Sally’s current belief may well be justified to a very substantial degree – though it is unlikely to be justified to the degree that it was when originally acquired (see further below). If on the other hand, none of these possibilities is realized –if Sally has no reason to think that her recalled beliefs are gener- ally true or that she is careful about her sources, if the belief has no special “vivacity” or other relevant phenomenological characteristics, if she has no justified corroborating beliefs, and if there are no associated details but only the bare belief about broccoli – then Sally has no real internalist reason for her belief and is not justified to any serious extent on an internalist account. And this, I submit, is intuitively the right result. In response to something like the first of these possibilities, Goldman offers a counter- example: (Sally 2) Sally read an account of the health benefits of eating broccoli in the National Enquirer (assumed to be an extremely unreliable source), and on that basis alone formed the belief that eating broccoli is conducive to good health. She currently retains this belief, but has entirely forgotten the source and has encountered no other evidence either pro or con. (IE 280) Goldman’s claim is that Sally’s belief in this second case is plainly not justified. my contrary view is that this depends again on the degree to which possibilities (1)–(4) are realized in this case. If all of those elements are present to a high degree, then Sally has very strong reasons for thinking that the belief is true. to the extent that some or all of these elements are absent, her justification will be weaker, with there being little if any justification if they are absent. this is the access internalist assessment, but it also seems to me intuitively plausible. G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 37 though Goldman does not say so very explicitly, another example, this time in IEAJ, can be interpreted as a further attempted counterexample to the internalist account of the justification of memory beliefs so far suggested: (Ursula) Initially Ursula justifiably believes some generalization G. She then encounters “a mountain of counterexamples” to G, each of them very obvious, that would entirely defeat her initial justification for G and in fact justify her in rejecting G, but nonetheless retains her belief in G (because she either fails to consider or fails to appreciate the force of the counterexam- ples). later she continues to believe G, but has entirely forgotten the counterexamples. (324) Goldman’s claim is that Ursula’s belief in G at the final stage is clearly unjustified, but that an internalist view cannot account for this result. on an access internalist view, as we have seen, the justification for Ursula’s belief will depend on the extent to which possibilities (1)–(4) above are realized in her case. Suppose that we stipulate that all of these possibilities are realized to a high degree. then Ursula will have a strong reason in support of G and on the access internalist view her belief will be strongly justified. the issue is whether, as Goldman thinks, this is a clearly unaccepta- ble result. I do not think that it is. Clearly there is something badly wrong with Ursula’s cognitive functioning over time in relation to G, but is it clear that her belief at the final stage is thereby unjustified, in spite of the strong reasons she then has for it? I will only say that I can find no clear rationale for such a view – without a question‐begging appeal to reliabilism – nor any intuition that clearly supports that specific result. the Ursula case raises the issue of whether the lack of justification at one stage neces- sarily rules out justification at a later stage. the flip side of this issue is the question of whether justification at one stage is, in the absence of further relevant considerations, automatically preserved to later stages. In IEAJ, Goldman also offers the following prin- ciple as “plausibly a right J‐rule,” on the basis of an essentially reliabilist rationale: (Pm) If S has a justified attitude D toward proposition p at t, and if S retains attitude D toward p until the later time t′, via memory, then, ceteris paribus, S is still permitted to have attitude D toward p at t′. (323) though the latter part of this principle is, oddly, not couched in terms of justification, presumably this means that if a belief was justified at t, then it is also justified at t′. thus the principle captures Goldman’s original assessment of Sally 1, though it is not restricted to cases of testimony. But if we add, as seems to be intended, that the degree of justification at t′ is the same as at t, it is in fact not very hard to see that (Pm) is in fact very implausible. It says in effect that if a person investigates some issue and, with all of the evidence and other relevant background considerations clearly in mind, arrives at a belief with a high degree of justi- fication, then merely by being retained in memory, that belief continues to have the same very high degree of justification even as the collateral evidence and other information fades or is lost entirely. It would be very nice if this were true, but it seems utterly plain that it is not. Since this happens gradually and can be offset to some extent by the sorts of 38 G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m elements described in possibilities (1)–(4) above, this is not the draconian result that Goldman describes as the “continual clearing of the justificational slate” (325), according to which justificational status is not preserved at all from one moment to the next. But he is right that from an internalist view, mere mnemonic retention in itself does nothing to preserve justification. It is clear from IEAJ that Goldman’s response would be that if (Pm) is rejected, then none of the stored beliefs involved in possibilities (1)–(4) would be justified (since few if any of the things appealed to in those possibilities could be held in mind at a moment) (325–6). Pursuing this issue in detail would be very complicated, and I have no space to do so here. For the moment, I will simply say that Goldman’s brief remarks on this point seem to me to make no very strong case for his negative conclusion. there is one other very important issue that needs to be raised to complete this discus- sion: whether Goldman’s own reliabilist view does any better or even as well with the problem of memory. It is in fact not difficult to find reasons for doubting that this is so. return to case Sally 2. Goldman wants to say that Sally’s belief in this case is unjustified. on a reliabilist view, this would be so if the belief‐acquiring process leading to Sally’s belief fails to be sufficiently reliable. Goldman would presumably describe the process in question as that of accepting beliefs from flagrantly unreliable sources. But, as the gener- ality problem shows, there are many other possible descriptions of that process. one of these is acquiring beliefs from sources that seem to Sally to be acceptable, and it is quite possible for all that has been said, that this process is very highly reliable (it might that the belief in question is an aberration), so that relative to this description of the process, the belief in question is justified. And something analogous could be said about the Ursula case. thus, while a full discussion of this issue is impossible here, the generality problem seems enough by itself to prevent reliabilism from having any clear advantage over access internalism in relation to memory. my conclusion is that, at least in the papers in question, Goldman has given nothing even approaching the sort of knock‐down objection to internalism that he seems to be claiming, even though there is no doubt much more to be said about all of these issues and especially this last one. Notes i I also still think that, as advocated in BonJour (2001), there is room in epistemology for both internalist and externalist views, even though I also think that only internalism can speak clearly to some of the deepest and historically most prominent questions. ii While this is obviously a foundationalist picture of sorts, it does not mean that all internalist views must resemble the standard versions of foundationalism. It is possible (though, I now believe, very implausible) that the main thing that is immediately available is coherence relations among beliefs that have no independent justification that is itself immediate. iii Here and elsewhere, C&F seem to take seriously the possibility that the justifying factors should be limited to occurrent mental states. I will largely ignore this (to my mind) very implausible version of mentalism; the reasons for thinking that it is unreasonably strong were indicated in the previous section. G ol D m A n A GAI n S t I nt E rn A l IS m 39 iv they offer a second reason that applies only to the supervenience version of mentalism, namely that it is analogous to a “counterpart thesis” in the philosophy of mind (Conee and Feldman 2001: 57–8). In the absence of a clear epistemological rationale, this seems to me to have little weight. v C&F discuss this sort of case briefly, but take no clear stand upon it. vi See BonJour (1998), though the discussion there does not make this point fully clear. vii there is a further argument here that I will largely set aside in the present discussion. Goldman argues that the standard for “right J‐rules” is also a J‐factor; that the most obvious such standard, namely truth‐conduciveness, is externalist in character; and that there is no plausible internalist alternative. the problem here is the largely undefended claim that the standard of truth‐conduciveness, one that I myself have always defended, is clearly external- ist in character. obviously truth‐conduciveness is not a mental state, so this claim is correct vis‐à‐vis mentalism. But it would take much more argument than Goldman offers here to show that we do not often have cognitive access to truth‐conduciveness. (Indeed, many of Goldman’s own arguments and claims, including one that follows shortly in IEAJ, seem to assume that we at least sometimes do have such access.) viii this is the single point on which I now believe that my discussion in BonJour (2001) was mistaken. there I said that I was “inclined to agree” that access to epistemic principles is required for justification. I did not then realize the full scope of what Goldman includes under this heading. But I also failed to distinguish clearly between a requirement that the person genuinely grasp the cogency of the justifying reason (which I accept) and a requirement that he be able to formulate the general principle underlying this cogency in explicitly epistemic terms (which I now reject). ix See Coneea and Feldman (2001) for a closely parallel discussion, and also BonJour (2001).

Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to discuss larry BonJour’s conception of internalism, given his importance in the defense of internalism in the epistemological arena. BonJour complains that my earlier critiques of internalism focus too heavily on mentalism rather than accessibilism, his own preferred form of internalism. Perhaps he is right about that. So here I shall focus single‐mindedly on the specific variant of accessibilism he presents here. (I must admit, however, that it strikes me more and more as a rather unusual species of internalism.) BonJour quotes with approval his own earlier formulation of access internalism as a theory of justification: [A] theory of justification is internalist only if it requires that all of the factors needed for a belief to be epistemically justified for a given person be cognitively accessible to that person, internal to his cognitive perspective… (1992: 132) A bit later, addressing what sort of accessibility is required, he says that “justification requires that the believer actually have in his cognitive possession a reason for thinking that the belief is true” (1992: 133). to understand his idea fully, of course, we need to know more about what he means by “accessibility” and “cognitive perspective.” It is a bit disappointing, however, to have some of these things explained by appeal to other terms or expressions which themselves needs explaining. For example, the phrase “internal to [one’s] cognitive perspective” (italics added) is used to define or illuminate the internal/external distinction. Doesn’t this border on definitional circularity? moreover, none of the terms employed here have self‐evident meanings in the context of philosophical attempts to give tight specifications of “internalism” and “externalism.” reply to BonJour r EP l y t o  B on J o U r 41 let me turn, however, to some of the crucial details in his “reasons” account of justi- fiedness. He writes: “What I intend by a reason is any ground or basis in virtue of which the belief in question is likely to be true, with the strength of the justification varying with the strength of the likelihood… I…insist that it be a complete reason, one that is enough by itself to yield such likelihood of truth.” I worry that his definition allows justifiedness to be credited to cognizers for all sorts of propositions that, intuitively, should not be accorded positive justificational status. For example, any logical or mathematical truth (no matter how complex) has a likelihood of 1.0 of being true. Furthermore, we can count anything “knowable” as a reason, and since any such reason will vacuously entail the truth of any of these necessary truths, justifiedness will automatically attach to any such propo- sition for any epistemic agent (however strong or weak their logical or mathematical power). Although BonJour speaks of “insight” and “intuition” in connection with such propositions, I don’t see that any such a priori faculty is really required under his defini- tion to secure justifiedness. A truth having a high likelihood suffices for high justifiedness. If one doesn’t like such counterexamples (because we all know that problems with neces- sities are all‐too‐common), we can take another example involving natural laws. Suppose roger undergoes a mental state (to which he has access) that could only – nomologically speaking – result from an approaching celestial body. then roger has a reason that makes it extremely likely (to be true) that such a celestial body is approaching. According to BonJour’s definition, roger is therefore justified in believing this, even if he has no infor- mation about such a celestial body. (I am here talking about propositional justifiedness, which I take to be BonJour’s main target. thus, in the case of roger and the previous cases, I am not assuming that the agent actually believes the target proposition.) let me now introduce another kind of worry highlighted by process reliabilism. However, let me first indicate that although propositional justification is probably BonJour’s main target, he owes (like any epistemological theorist owes us) an account of doxastic justifiedness too. But BonJour’s theory is ill‐equipped to provide such an account. Suppose that Amanda has very strong reasons for believing P, say the conjunction of propositions Q , r, S, and t, which are jointly accessible for her and make P highly prob- able. Further suppose that Amanda proceeds to form a belief in P. It seems, then, that BonJour’s reason requirement is satisfied, and Amanda’s belief in P should be justified. But suppose, finally, that Amanda’s belief in P is formed without any attention to Q , r, S, and/or t. She is led to believe it by a completely different route, starting with proposi- tions she believes unjustifiedly; and using an absurd method of inference. then what is the (doxastic) J‐status of her belief in P? Clearly, it is unjustified. As I have long argued  –  and it is fairly widely accepted  –  doxastic justifiedness hinges on the agent’s using a good (causal) “route” to belief. BonJour’s account, however, completely ignores this factor. A spin‐off of the requirement of appropriate belief production concerns belief‐ retention over time. I emphasize this issue in two articles on internalism and externalism (covered by BonJour), focusing on the role played by preservative memory. As argued in those papers, if a belief is formed at t in a way that earns it a certain J‐status at t (whether positive or negative), then if the belief is preserved over time by memory, it will tend to retain its original J‐status, unless new evidence is acquired in the interim. So at a later 42 r EP l y t o  B on J o U r time t’, the original J‐status is maintained. BonJour discusses this case in detail and raises some very relevant and probing challenges. I agree that the statement of the fore- going principle needs modification and/or refinement to circumvent these problems. However, I save an explanation of how to make this modification for my reply to the next contributor, thomas Kelly, who raises many of the same issues about preservative memory. Given limitations of space, I end this reply at this juncture and return to preservative memory challenges in my reply to Kelly. Goldman and His Critics, First Edition. Edited by Brian P.

Historical versus Current Time Slice Theories in Epistemology T H o m a S K E ll y 3 1 Introduction Alvin Goldman’s “What is justified belief?” (1979) is one of the great papers of twentieth‐ century epistemology. In my view, one mark of its richness is the fact that, although it has proven extremely influential and has generated an enormous literature, some of its central themes remain relatively underexplored to this day. Here I want to explore one theme that in my judgment has not received as much sustained attention as it warrants: the distinction between historical and current time slice theories of epistemic justification. The plan for the chapter is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the hermeneutical tasks of explicating and contextualizing the distinction between historical and current time slice theories. Among other things, I propose that the distinction is best understood in terms of a metaphysical grounding thesis, an approach that I argue improves upon more familiar characterizations that appeal to the notion of supervenience. Beginning in sec- tion 3, I turn to the question of which type of theory we should accept. There, I critically examine Goldman’s longstanding claim that no current time slice theory can possibly do justice to the epistemic role of preservative memory. The verdict that I reach is mixed. On the one hand, I argue that a principle governing preservative memory proposed by Goldman – a principle which, if true, would vindicate his claim that no current time slice theory is tenable – is actually false. On the other hand, I argue that a recent attempt by Earl Conee and Richard Feldman to meet Goldman’s challenge by providing a current time slice reconstruction of the relevant epistemic phenomena is similarly unsuccessful. In section 4, I develop my own argument against current time slice theories, an argument that proceeds from the detailed consideration of certain cases involving temporally extended reasoning. 44 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 2 The Distinction “What is justified belief?” introduced Goldman’s distinctive brand of reliabilism to the philosophical world. Interestingly, although that view soon thereafter became generally known as “process reliabilism,” in the original paper Goldman consistently refers to it as historical reliabilism. Presumably, this is to underscore the fact that the view on offer is a species of the genus historical theory of justification as opposed to the genus current time slice theory of justification. I believe that this distinction, although potentially a useful tool for classifying epistemological theories, is itself far from transparent. In this section, I explore how it is best understood. First, some background. The practice of distinguishing between “current time slice” theories and “historical” theories of some domain – or at least, the use of this terminology to mark the relevant distinction – originated not in epistemology but in political philoso- phy. In his early work of libertarian political philosophy, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), Robert nozick claimed that many popular theories of distributive justice are hopelessly flawed in virtue of being current time slice theories as opposed to historical theories. That is, according to such views, whether the distribution of resources that obtains at a given moment in time is just, or the extent to which it is just, is determined or fixed by a com- plete specification of how the resources are distributed among members of the relevant population at that very time. Consider, for example, a simple version of egalitarianism, according to which an ideally just distribution is one in which every member of the popu- lation has an equal share of the total resources, and the extent to which a given distribution is just varies inversely with the extent to which it departs from this ideal. On this view, a comprehensive snapshot of how things stand at a given moment in time encodes all of the information one would need in order to determine the justice of the situation; for this reason, the simple egalitarian view is a paradigm of a current time slice theory. nozick held that no current time slice theory could possibly be the correct story about distributive justice, inasmuch as whether things are just at a given time depends not only on how resources are distributed then, but also on historical facts about how that distribu- tion actually arose. For example, if some members of society have less than others because they have been in jail for past war crimes, such historical facts can legitimately make a difference to our assessment of the current distribution. In short, when it comes to distributive justice, history matters (nozick 1974: 153–5). Goldman holds that no current time slice view could possibly be the correct story about epistemic justification. Strikingly, he identifies, as examples of current time slice views in epistemology, traditional versions of foundationalism and coherentism. Suppose that we take a snapshot of someone’s psychological profile at a given moment in time, so that we know both what she believes and the relations that obtain among her beliefs. (We  can include here both the logical and evidential relations that obtain between the contents of her beliefs, as well as the psychological relations that obtain among the mental states themselves). Suppose further that this psychological profile also includes all of the experiences that the person is undergoing at that particular moment, or her total experiential state. Traditional foundationalists and coherentists will hold that this information suffices to fix the facts about what the person is justified in believing at that moment. Against this, H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 45 Goldman insists that such information is insufficient to determine what she is justified in believing. Rather, what she is currently justified in believing will typically depend in part on purely historical facts about how she came to be in that total psychological state. In epistemology, history matters. For Goldman, this alleged historicity of epistemic justifica- tion (2009, 2011) is one of the main insights that process reliabilism captures. But more generally, any view on which purely historical facts can make a difference to what one is currently justified in believing counts as a historical theory of justification. As I understand it, the distinction between current time slice and historical theories in epistemology concerns the question of whether historical factors ever make a difference to one’s justification for believing various propositions, as opposed to the question of whether historical factors ever make a difference to which propositions one is in a position to believe or entertain in the first place. Perhaps on the best view of content that we possess, the fact that I am currently capable of believing that George Washington was the first President of the United States depends on my having had a certain history, or on my standing in a certain social‐historical tradition that connects me with a particular individual who lived centuries ago. On this view, a molecule‐for‐molecule identical doppelganger created moments ago in an astronomically improbable cosmic accident would not be capable of believing the same proposition. now, if the fact that I am currently in a position to believe that George Washington was the first president depends on my having had a certain history, then presumably, the fact that I am currently in a position to justifiably believe this proposition depends on my having had a certain history as well. But this is not something that a current time slice theorist need deny. Her driving thought is that my justification for the belief depends exclusively on currently obtaining states of affairs, even if the fact that I am able to entertain that content in the first place does not. In adjudicating between the current time slice theorist and the historical theorist, we should hold fixed the contents that indi- viduals are capable of believing, and inquire into the role that history plays (or does not play) in determining facts about the their justification for believing propositions in which those contents figure. Thus, the current time slice theorist, no less than the historical theorist, is free to accept causal‐historical theories of reference. i Compare the way in which the traditional debate between rationalists and empiricists has often been conducted. many rationalists have been happy to concede that sense expe- rience is necessary for our being able to entertain certain contents, but they have insisted that there is a distinct, philosophically interesting and important question about whether sense experience plays an essential role in the justification of beliefs in which those contents figure. Analogously, the current time slice theorist is free to admit that even if we give an ineliminably historical account of our ability to entertain certain propositions, there is a distinct, philosophically interesting and important issue about the role that history plays (or does not play) in the justification of those beliefs. notwithstanding the influence of Goldman’s writings, current time slice views remain popular within contemporary epistemology. Here, for example, are Earl Conee and Richard Feldman, articulating their preferred version of Evidentialism: The epistemic justification of anyone’s doxastic attitude towards any proposition strongly supervenes on the evidence that the person has at the time. (2004: 101) 46 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE Similarly, in a recent paper Sarah moss defends “current time slice epistemology,” which she describes as follows: …what is rationally permissible or obligatory for you at some time is entirely determined by what mental states you are in at that time. This supervenience claim governs facts…about the rationality of your full beliefs and your degreed belief states…The fundamental facts about rationality are exhausted by these temporally local facts. (2015: 172)ii more generally, the kind of traditional internalist foundationalism that Goldman origi- nally identified as a paradigm of a current time slice view (and of which Feldman and Conee’s “evidentialism” is a notable specimen) continues to enjoy significant popularity within contemporary epistemology. On the other hand, historical theories enjoy considerable popularity within contempo- rary epistemology as well. In addition to the obvious example of process reliabilists, con- sider standard Bayesians who treat conditionalization as a diachronic norm of belief revision. For the standard Bayesian, it is not enough, in order to be rational, simply to have probabilistically coherent beliefs at every moment in time. nor is it enough to have probabilistically coherent beliefs that respect other synchronic norms such as the Principal Principle (lewis 1986) or Regularity (Kemeny 1955; Shimony 1955). Rather, one must also conditionalize on one’s evidence through time: when I acquire a new piece of evidence and change my beliefs in response, whether my new beliefs are rational ones for me to hold depends inter alia on historical facts about my past conditional probabilities. Thus, the issue of whether to accept a current time slice or historical theory is an issue about which the epistemological community is substantially divided at the present time, with formidable and sophisticated philosophers on each side. While my ultimate concern is with this issue, a prior question is how exactly the distinction should be characterized. In my view, the best way to characterize the distinction is itself a substantive philosophical issue, the difficulty of which is sometimes underestimated. let’s consider some of the subtleties that arise. The current time slice theorist holds that there is a certain temporal constraint on the kinds of factors that can make a difference to the epistemic status of an individual’s beliefs, a constraint that the historical theorist rejects. How should we characterize the constraint? When he first introduced the distinction, Goldman offered the following informal gloss: “A current time slice theory makes the justificational status of a belief wholly a function of what is true of the cognizer at the time of belief ” (1979: 41, emphasis his). On this account of the distinction then, the current time slice theorist accepts, while the historical theorist denies, the following thesis: (CTS) Facts about what S is epistemically justified in believing at time t wholly depend on what is true of S at time t. However, this account of the distinction seems unsatisfactory. One problem is the fol- lowing. Intuitively, what is true of me at any given time includes claims that are made true by my historical properties. For example, it is true of me now that I am forty‐one years old, H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 47 and that I was born over four decades ago. Consider then my current belief that George Washington was the first President. Assuming that I arrived at this belief in a reliable manner in the past, why shouldn’t this historical property count as something that is true of me now, “at the time of [current] belief,” in the same way that my being forty‐one years old counts as something that is true of me at the current time? Thus, the present account threatens to incorrectly classify process reliabilism itself as a current time slice theory.iii Can we improve on things? As we saw above, in characterizing their views both moss and Conee and Feldman explicitly invoke the notion of supervenience. In some of his later writings (2009, 2011), Goldman himself discusses the issue in terms of a supervenience claim. Consider then the following thesis: (CTS‐Supervenience) Facts about what S is epistemically justified in believing at time t supervene on the non‐historical facts that obtain at time t. On this way of understanding the issue that divides them, the current time slice theorist accepts this thesis, while the historical theorist denies it. I believe that this proposal marks an improvement over the previous one. In particular, it cleanly and correctly classifies the process reliabilist as an historical theorist. For the process reliabilist will hold that the justificational status of my current belief that George Washington was the first president might depend on historical facts about how I acquired this belief; the reliabilist will thus reject (CTS‐Supervenience). moreover, it is also clear that Conee and Feldman style evidentialists will accept the claim and thus be correctly classified as current time slice theorists; again, this is to the credit of the proposal. However, when we consider a broader range of epistemological theories, doubts arise. Consider, for example, a view according to which what one is currently justified in believing supervenes on one’s current evidence, where one’s current evidence consists of all and only those propositions that one currently knows. iv (CTS‐Supervenience) clearly counts such a view as a current time slice theory, and at first glance this seems like the obviously correct verdict. However, on closer inspection things are more complicated. much depends, I think, on the story that the theorist proceeds to tell about the role that historical factors play (or do not play) in determining whether a believer counts as currently knowing a proposi- tion. For example, suppose that the theorist proceeds to offer an historical reliabilist account of knowledge, according to which whether something that you currently believe qualifies as a case of knowledge frequently depends on historical facts about the circumstances in which you originally acquired the belief. Should the resulting account of justified belief still count as a current time slice theory as opposed to a historical theory, simply because the theorist is willing to endorse (CTS‐Supervenience)? That seems doubtful. let us look more closely at the broadly Williamsonian view, according to which what you are currently justified in believing depends upon what you currently know. When an individual knows a proposition, it is typically not a brute fact that she knows it; rather, there is generally some non‐trivial story about how she knows it. Consider your current belief that the first digit of pi is 3. Suppose that a theorist suggests that the true story about how you currently know this proposition is simply this: you remember this fact, in the factive, knowledge‐entailing sense of “remember.” In this sense, that you currently 48 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE remember that the first digit of pi is 3, when taken together with the fact that you did not always know this proposition, entails the actual existence of some past learning event. Consider next some proposition that you are currently justified in believing because your evidence includes this piece of memory knowledge (perhaps: the proposition that the first digit of pi is a prime number). On the view in question, the fact that you are now in a position to justifiably believe this proposition is ultimately grounded in a set of facts that includes purely historical facts, for example, facts that a certain past learning event actually occurred. It is at the very least unclear that such a view should be classified as a current time slice account as opposed to an historical theory. Contrast the view just described with a different account of memory‐based justifica- tion. According to this alternative account, you are justified in believing that p on the basis of memory when (1) you have a current apparent memory as of p, a state that provides prima facie justification for believing p, and (2) you currently lack any reason to distrust this apparent memory. Such a view is clearly a current time slice view, in a way that the epis- temological view described in the preceding paragraph is not. In order to bring the present classificatory issue into sharper focus, consider also Russell’s (1921) famous skeptical scenario, in which the entire world and all of its inhabit- ants were actually created five minutes ago, together with all of the apparent memories and stored representations that each of us has of a more distant past. (Following Russell, we will assume for the sake of argument that the inhabitants in such a scenario are capable of entertaining all of the propositions that we are capable of entertaining.) In Russell’s scenario, each of us has exactly the same apparent memories, stored representations, and non‐factive mental states that we have in the non‐skeptical “good case,” in which the actual past history of the world is vast. Epistemologists disagree about whether one would be equally justified in one’s beliefs in the good case and the bad case; the present issue, however, is whether an epistemological view that holds that the justificational status of one’s beliefs might differ radically in the two scenarios can still qualify as a “current time slice” view as opposed to an historical view. notice that on the broadly Williamsonian view described above, we should expect individuals to differ (and indeed, differ radically) in what they are currently justified in believing depending on whether they are in the good case or the bad case. After all, in the good case, the inhabitants have far more memory knowledge than in the bad case, because history in the good case contains countless past learning events that did not actually occur in the much briefer past history of the bad case. The individuals in the bad case are thus justified in believing far less than the individuals in the good case, despite the fact that from their current perspective things are utterly indistinguishable. nevertheless, (CTS‐Supervenience) classifies this account as a current time slice theory, because what each individual is justified in believing does supervene on what that individual currently knows. However, one might think that allowing historical facts to make this kind of difference is not in the spirit of current time slice epistemology. As further support for that judgment, consider also the political philosophy case. We can imagine a possible view about distributive justice on which any individual who currently has a certain status is entitled to such‐and‐such a share of the society’s total resources, but where it is a necessary condition of having that status that one has a par- ticular history. For example, perhaps a person has the entitlement‐conferring status if he H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 49 is a military veteran, or if he was once forced to live in an internment camp. notice that a theory of distributive justice that incorporates elements such as these might very well still satisfy a supervenience claim to the effect that facts about the distributive share to which a person is entitled supervene on facts about his or her current status. nevertheless, any such theory would at best be a current time slice view in name only: for any significant theoretical purpose, it is better classified as an historical theory. These considerations suggest that the supervenience criterion is overly inclusive when it comes to classifying theories as current time slice theories. Can we do better? Here I believe that we can profitably employ the notion of metaphysical grounding. v On the broadly Williamsonian view described above, when you are justified in believing something on the basis of your current evidence, the fact that you are justified in believing that proposition is grounded in facts about what you currently know. But, assuming that facts about what you currently know are not themselves brute facts, facts about what you currently know will be grounded in further facts; for example, facts about what you visu- ally perceive to be the case, or facts about what you remember. Facts about what you remember will be grounded in yet further facts. On some but not all views about the epistemology of memory, some of these further facts will be historical facts having to do with the actual occurrence of certain past learning events. Inasmuch as at least some ways of developing the broadly Williamsonian view that justification supervenes on current knowledge will result in theories of justification that it is plausible to count as historical theories, this is because those theories will allow facts about what you are justified in believing to be ultimately grounded in a set of facts that includes historical facts. Again, contrast an epistemological view that offers a current time slice reconstruction of memo- rial justification: for example, a view according to which whenever you are justified in holding a belief on the basis of memory, this is in virtue of having a current apparent memory with the relevant content – here, facts about what you are currently justified in believing bottom out in exclusively non‐historical facts. Consider then the following thesis: (CTS‐Grounding) Facts about what S is justified in believing at time t are ultimately grounded in a set of non‐historical facts. We can then say: a current time slice theorist is someone who accepts this thesis, while a historical theorist is someone who denies it. Although I am inclined to regard the grounding formulation as preferable to the super- venience formulation, I do not claim to have made a decisive case. moreover, even if the grounding formulation does constitute an improvement, I have no great confidence that it is ultimately correct. At the very least, a better characterization would not simply take the distinction between historical facts and non‐historical facts for granted. Although ‘current time slice theory’ and ‘historical theory’ might seem like philosophers’ technical terms whose extensions are subject to being fixed by stipulation, I believe that we have some intuitive grasp on the distinction that makes further theorizing about it worthwhile. (In this respect, compare the literature in metaphysics devoted to explicating the distinction between ‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic.’) But I will not pursue the matter further here. In any 50 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE case, the line of objection that I develop in section 4 below purports to undermine current time slice epistemology given either the supervenience characterization or the grounding characterization (or indeed, any other characterization that I have come across). Regardless of how exactly the distinction is best explicated, one thing that should be clear by now is the following: if historical facts ever make the relevant kind of difference to what one is justified in believing, the historical theorist wins, and the current time slice theorist loses. That is, the historical theorist can agree that we are often in a position to draw all sorts of conclusions about how a believer is doing epistemically, given only the kind of information that would uncontroversially be included in the believer’s current time slice profile. For example, suppose that a believer’s doxastic corpus at a given moment is riddled with inconsistencies. In that case, the historical theorist can agree that, even without knowing anything about the history of how the believer came to be in this state, we are in a position to conclude that he is doing badly from an epistemic point of view. Quite simply, there is no possible history that would make it epistemically respectable to have that possi- ble combination of beliefs. Perhaps here there is at least a potential contrast with the political philosophy case. I take it that on nozick’s own historical account of distributive justice, if one were com- pletely ignorant of how an existing distribution of resources arose, one would not be in a position to definitively conclude anything about the justice of that distribution: at least in principle, any distribution could be just (or unjust) if it were brought about by the right kind of history. For example, even in the extreme case in which one member of a popula- tion has all of the resources while the rest have none, there are possible histories whose actuality would undermine a charge of injustice. (Imagine, for example, that the one person ended up with all of the resources because each of the others freely and clearhead- edly chose to give him their own shares.) Perhaps that view about justice is incorrect, as a matter of substantive normative political philosophy. But even if it is false, the thought that one needs to know at least something about the relevant history before one is in a position to make definitive pronouncements about what justice requires seems to be at least an arguable position. By contrast, I take it that there is nothing at all to be said for the analogous view in epistemology, according to which an individual whose current beliefs are riddled with inconsistencies might turn out to be fully rational or justified, given a suitable history of how he came to be in that state. Crucially then, the historical theorist is not committed to anything this strong. A final interpretive issue concerns whether we should understand the debate as about the nature of propositional justification or doxastic justification.vi As is often noted, even if one is propositionally justified in believing a proposition, and one believes that proposi- tion, it does not follow that one’s belief is doxastically justified. For example, suppose that I have compelling evidence that today will be a bad day, and I believe that today will be a bad day, but I do not hold this belief on the basis of my compelling evidence: rather, I hold the belief because of an irrationally pessimistic temperament which leads me to believe that every day will be a bad day, regardless of my evidence. In these circumstances, I am propositionally justified in believing that today will be a bad day, but my belief itself is doxastically unjustified. We can thus distinguish two different current time slice theses, corresponding to these two notions of justification. According to the first thesis, facts H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 51 about what one is propositionally justified in believing are ultimately grounded in/supervene upon the non‐historical facts. According to the second thesis, facts about the status of one’s beliefs as doxastically justified or doxastically unjustified are ultimately grounded in/supervene upon the non‐historical facts. In principle, a current time slice theorist might endorse either of these theses, or both. Here is a motivation for the current time slice theorist to insist that his view should be understood (at least in the first instance) as a view about propositional as opposed to doxastic justification. As noted above, in a case in which your being propositionally justi- fied in holding a given belief consists in your having compelling evidence that it is true, whether your belief is doxastically justified will depend upon whether it is properly based on that evidence. However, many leading accounts of the basing relation incorporate a causal requirement, to the effect that your belief is based on your evidence only if your holding the belief is caused or brought about by your possession of the evidence. now, given that causes typically precede their effects, it seems that your believing a proposition at any particular instant could at best be caused by your possessing good evidence at some slightly earlier moment. The worry for a philosopher drawn to a current time slice account of doxastic justification then, is this: in order to understand doxastic justification, we need to invoke the basing relation; but it might turn out that the correct account of the basing relation will invoke causal notions that cannot be adequately captured in terms of current time slice notions. At least at first pass, it seems as though the current time slice theorist might simply bypass this line of objection by insisting that her view is about propositional justification, as opposed to doxastic justification. In fact, as least in my experience explicit statements or expressions of commitments to current time slice views are often most naturally under- stood as being about propositional justification as opposed to doxastic justification. vii While I suspect that such an attempt to vindicate current time slice epistemology about propositional justification while bypassing or remaining neutral about doxastic jus- tification would ultimately encounter difficulties, I will not pursue the point here. Given the kinds of considerations that Goldman deploys against current time slice theories, I think that it is clear enough that he regards such theories as untenable either as accounts of propositional (ex ante) justification or of doxastic (ex post) justification. This is a view that I share, and for which I will argue in section 4. First, however, I want to examine Goldman’s idea that current time slice views cannot do justice to the role of preservative memory in so‐called “forgotten evidence” cases. 3 Preservative Memory and Forgotten Evidence Goldman holds that no current time slice theory can do justice to the epistemic role of memory. Indeed, a comparison of his writings across the decades suggests that he consist- ently regards the epistemic role of memory as Exhibit A in the case against current time slice theories, and that he regards it as a decisive consideration.viii In particular, Goldman places great emphasis on what are sometimes referred to in the literature as “forgotten evidence” cases. Suppose that at some earlier time, one knows some proposition on the 52 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE basis of compelling evidence. Over time, one increasingly loses one’s original evidence while retaining the belief via memory. At some later time, one still has the original belief but lacks any evidence that it is true. like a number of others, Goldman holds that no acceptable epistemological theory would require one to give up a belief that one has successfully retained via memory merely because one finds oneself without evidence that it is true at the later time. ix According to Goldman, the true epistemic principle that governs this kind of case is  an explicitly historical or diachronic one. This is his principle for Preservative memory or (Pm): (PM) If S has a justified attitude D toward proposition p at t, and if S retains attitude D toward p until the later time t’, via memory, then ceteris paribus, S is still permitted to have attitude D toward p at t’. (2009: 109) He immediately adds that “The ceteris paribus phrase is intended to accommodate the possibility that new evidence is acquired between t and t’, thereby raising or lowering the appropriate level of credence for S vis‐à‐vis p”. For Goldman, the truth of this principle underwrites the justifiedness of many of our beliefs.x If he is correct about this, and if (as I argued above) we should understand the current time slice theorist as committed to a certain grounding claim, then it is clear enough that the current time slice theorist loses. For consider all of the things you are currently justified in believing because you remember that they are true. On Goldman’s picture, when we cite the facts in virtue of which you are now justified in holding these beliefs, we will end up citing historical facts about what you were justified in believing at earlier times. However, I believe that Goldman’s principle is subject to counterexample. To my mind, the clearest examples of cases where it fails have the following form. At some earlier time, one has absolutely overwhelming evidence that some proposition is true, evidence sufficient to justify an attitude of certainty or near certainty. Over a long interval of time, one loses all of this evidence while acquiring no new supporting evidence; at some later time, one thus finds oneself with no evidence at all that the proposition is true. Intuitively, it seems that this process should put at least some dent in one’s credence: given one’s com- plete lack of evidence at the later time, it would not be justifiable to remain virtually certain that the proposition is true. For example, consider the tenseless proposition that during my second year of gradu- ate school I lived at such‐and‐such an address. undoubtedly, I was extremely confident that this proposition was true during my second year of graduate school. moreover, given the overwhelming evidence that I then had that that was my address, I assume that my attitude of near certainty was justified. Suppose then, that at some point during my second year of graduate school I justifiably believed with 99% certainty that during my second year of graduate school, I lived at such‐and‐such an address. In the years that have elapsed since then, however, I have completely lost whatever evidence I once had that the relevant prop- osition is true; moreover, I have also long since forgotten the relevant fact. But suppose that the following was the case: although I’ve long since lost every bit evidence I once had H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 53 that the relevant proposition is true, I’ve managed to retain the relevant proposition in memory. Would it still be rationally permissible or justifiable for me to be 99% certain – that is, every bit as confident as I ever was – that the relevant proposition is true, despite my complete lack of any evidence that it is? Although this is what Goldman’s principle suggests, that seems like the wrong result. losing evidence should make at least some difference, even in cases in which one’s memory sustains the original belief. While I think that examples such as this provide a good reason to reject Principle (Pm), I acknowledge that there are things that a defender of (Pm) might say in response. How might one attempt to defend (Pm)? For starters, the defender of (Pm) should emphasize that its truth is consistent with the possibility that losing evidence over time does in fact worsen one’s epistemic position with respect to the relevant proposition in significant ways. In particular, the defender of (Pm) might insist that the primary epistemic conse- quence of losing evidence for a retained belief is not that one is thereby required to decrease one’s confidence, but rather that one’s confidence is less normatively robust or resilient in the face of counterevidence. Here, the idea would be something like this. When I possess overwhelming evidence that I live at such‐and‐such an address (evidence of a kind that would justify an attitude of certainty or near certainty) that belief is relatively immune to being undermined by counterevidence that suggests otherwise: given my over- whelming evidence, I am in a position to (justifiably) conclude that such counterevidence is misleading. However, once I have lost all of the evidence that originally supported my belief, I am no longer in a position to respond in this way. Thus, although I am permitted to retain my 99% confidence level so long as my belief is preserved via memory, my con- fidence is much more normatively fragile than it was previously, and it is in this respect that my epistemic position has grown weaker in virtue of losing my original evidence. What should we say about the possibility of defending (Pm) along these lines? On the one hand, I think that losing evidence often does have the effect of making one’s belief less robust or resilient in the face of challenge; the phenomenon to which this defense appeals is a genuine one. However, this way of defending (Pm) retains the implausible conse- quence that one can remain certain even after one has lost all of one’s evidence, so long as one was originally justified in being certain and has retained the belief via memory. The most natural view about such cases, I take it, is that losing all of one’s evidence should both diminish one’s certainty to at least some extent, while also rendering one’s belief less robust or resilient in the face of challenge. Another approach to defending (Pm) attempts to accommodate the intuitive verdict that losing all of one’s evidence should result in a loss of certainty by exploiting the ceteris paribus clause that Goldman builds into the principle. Recall that Goldman tells us that “The ceteris paribus phrase is intended to accommodate the possibility that new evidence is acquired between t and t’, thereby raising or lowering the appropriate level of credence for S vis‐à‐vis p”. now, it seems clear that in the case involving my former address, I do acquire new information between the earlier time and the later time, information that (at least plau- sibly) seems to warrant a diminution in my confidence in the target proposition. For exam- ple, I now possess the information that a significant amount of time has passed since I last lived at the address at which I lived during my second year of graduate school. Obviously, this is not information that I either had or could have had at the earlier time, during my second year 54 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE of graduate school. Plausibly, when I put this information together with my background knowledge that my memory is fallible, a reduction in my 99% confidence that I lived at such‐and‐such an address during my second year of graduate school would seem to be in order. In this way, a defender of (Pm) might argue that he or she can agree with the intuitive verdict that I should not be virtually certain at the later time, when my evidence is gone and I am relying solely on my memory: this and similar cases do not constitute counterexamples to (Pm) because in such cases the ceteris paribus clause is not satisfied. my main reason for dissatisfaction with a response along these lines is that it seems to divest (Pm) of anything like the significance that Goldman claims for it. Recall that according to Goldman, it is this principle, or something in the near neighborhood, which underwrites the justificatory role of preservative memory: “It is highly likely that almost all justified stored beliefs depend for their justifiedness on (Pm)” (2009: 110). However, if we read the ceteris paribus clause liberally enough so that cases like the one considered here fall outside of its scope, then the obvious worry is that principle (Pm) will turn out to have very limited application indeed. For in almost any case in which there is some significant time interval between the earlier time and the later time one will have acquired at least some information that bears (at least indirectly) on what attitude one should take towards the target proposition. After all, in any case in which one is relying solely on one’s memory, one would seem to have the same kind of reason to adjust one’s credence (even if only slightly) that we adverted to in arguing that the principle does not deem it permissible for me to remain 99% confident in the case involving my former address. In sum, although the truth of Goldman’s principle (Pm) would suffice to vindicate his charge that the current time slice theorist cannot do justice to the phenomenon of pre- servative memory, the principle does not seem compelling. On the other hand, we should not conclude from the falsity of Goldman’s principle that his charge is incorrect. Indeed, I think that it is far from clear that the current time slice theorist does have a good story to tell about forgotten evidence cases. In order to illustrate the difficulties that confront the current time slice theorist on this front, I want to conclude this section by looking at a recent attempt by Conee and Feldman (2011) to meet Goldman’s challenge, an attempt that I take to be unsuccessful. Conee and Feldman’s account is motivated by the perceived inadequacy of a familiar current time slice account of memorial justification, an account that we have already encountered in passing. According to that account, whenever you are justified in holding a belief on the basis of memory, this is because you are having an apparent memory at that time, where apparent memories are understood as occurrent, nondoxastic states with propositional content that provide prima facie justification for beliefs. On this view then, my current belief that I had cereal for breakfast this morning is justified by my current apparent memory as of having had cereal for breakfast this morning, along with my lack of any reason to distrust this apparent memory. (Compare the familiar view about percep- tion, according to which perceptual experiences bestow prima facie justification on perceptual beliefs with matching content.) As Goldman points out (2011: 129–30, 136–7), whatever initial plausibility this view enjoys seems to depend upon focusing exclusively on episodic memory (which involves the recollection of specific past events, such as my eating breakfast this morning) as opposed H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 55 to the kind of preservation of information that is characteristic of semantic memory. Goldman focuses particularly on cases in which semantic memory preserves stored beliefs for which one has forgotten one’s original evidence. For example, on the basis of memory, I know that the American Civil War began in 1861 and ended in 1865, and that Abraham lincoln was president of the union while it was fought. moreover, I knew these things yesterday as well as today, despite the fact that yesterday the American Civil War never crossed my mind, and despite the fact that by then I had forgotten whatever evidence prompted me to take up the beliefs in the first place. Presumably, if I knew these things yesterday, then I was justified in believing them then. But as Goldman points out, it is psychologically unrealistic to think that for each of the many justified beliefs that you have stored in memory right now, you are currently experiencing an apparent memory with the right content that justifies you in believing it. Conee and Feldman offer a current time slice account that avoids this implausible com- mitment. According to Conee and Feldman, when one has a justified stored memory belief that q for which the original evidence has been lost, one is in a distinct mental state that justifies that belief. However, unlike the familiar view that Goldman criticizes, the justifying mental state is not an apparent memory as of q, or indeed, any occurrent mental state. Rather, the relevant mental state is a dispositional state, viz. the state of being disposed to recollect that q. For Conee and Feldman, this dispositional state is non‐factive: one can be disposed to recollect q even if q is false (304). A person who has the disposition to recollect q has the potential to bring q to mind with the phenomenology of activating a memory, specifically the memory that q. This is not true merely because he has the stored belief that q. many of our stored beliefs are recalled as things we merely believe, not as things we know. But some are recalled as things we know. We will say that a “disposition to recollect” a proposition is a disposition to bring to mind the proposition as known. (2011: 304) Thus, the idea is that even when I’m not thinking about the Civil War, I am in some current state that provides justification for my stored belief that the Civil War ended in 1865: namely, my disposition to bring to mind that proposition with a certain phenome- nology: the phenomenology of this is something that I know, or this is something that I know via memory. Conee and Feldman emphasize that a “disposition to recollect” need not have any temporal extension; it is “a potentially momentary state” (305). But at any moment when the state obtains, it provides defeasible evidence for a belief with the relevant con- tent. Thus, if it were acceptable, this view would undermine Goldman’s claim that the current time slicer has no viable story to tell about forgotten evidence cases. However, I believe that we should reject the Conee–Feldman account, on the grounds that it exaggerates the importance of phenomenology (or the disposition to have a certain phenomenology) in cases of the relevant kind. Although I believe that this point can be appreciated by reflecting on everyday examples, a thought experiment is useful for making it more cleanly. Suppose that when we meet the Alpha Centaurians, they resemble us to a surprising extent, with the following striking exception: compared to us, they give every indication of having fantastic memories. Thus, an Alpha Centaurian who learns some random fact in early childhood will almost invariably deliver that information when 56 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE prompted decades later, even if she has never consciously entertained it in the interim. Similarly, when an Alpha Centaurian has to make a practical decision to which some fact learned long ago is relevant, she almost invariably takes that fact into account, and so on. unsurprisingly, when Alpha Centurians and human beings compete against one another in memory games, the latter are no match for the former: even the reigning human champion gets thoroughly trounced whenever she competes against an arbitrary Alpha Centaurian. Because of this, it is generally accepted that the Alpha Centaurians greatly exceed us in a capacity that we both possess. (We can even imagine that the underlying physical mech- anism that realizes this capacity is much the same in the two species; it is just that their “memory box” is more capacious than ours.) However, one day the following surprising discovery is made: although the Alpha Centaurians seem to remember everything, they lack dispositions to recollect propositions. That is, they never have the phenomenology of activating a memory, or the phenomenology of a recalled proposition’s being presented to them as something that they know; in fact, they do not even have the potential for this phenomenology. (To be clear, it’s not that the Alpha Centaurians have the phenomenology of not knowing or merely believing that the recalled proposition is true, or the phenomenol- ogy of its being false or uncertain.) Rather, their impressive capacity to draw upon and exploit their prior learning is simply not accompanied by any phenomenology at all. The key question then, is this: once we discover that Alpha Cenaturians lack disposi- tions to recollect (in Conee and Feldman’s sense), should we conclude that they are not actually remembering things, at least in cases in which the beliefs in question are stored beliefs for which they currently lack evidence? (Perhaps we should make them give back the trophies they have won in past memory contests, on the grounds that they were not genu- inely remembering.) It seems clear that we neither would nor should conclude this. Rather, we both would and should continue to believe that their memories are superior to our own, notwithstanding their lack of dispositions to recollect in Conee and Feldman’s sense. What follows from this? As the case of the Alpha Centaurians shows, having a disposi- tion to recollect is not necessary for genuinely remembering. But genuinely remembering is sufficient for being justified in believing. (If I genuinely remember that the Civil War ended in 1865, then I am justified in believing that it did.) Therefore, in a case in which I genuinely remember a belief that is currently held in storage, I am justified in believing the relevant proposition, even if I am not disposed to recollect that proposition in Conee and Feldman’s sense. This suggests that the true story about why we are justified in the kinds of examples that Goldman discusses does not essentially appeal to dispositions to recol- lect: Conee and Feldman’s attempt to offer a current time slice reconstruction of our justification in such cases by invoking this notion is unsound. 4 Against Current Time Slice Epistemology: Justification and Reasoning Over Time In standard forgotten evidence cases, one maintains the same belief over some interval of time, against a background of changes in one’s evidence. One obstacle to convincingly deploying such cases against current time slice views is that there is considerable intuitive, H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 57 pre‐theoretical pressure in favor of the thought that as one forgets the evidence that orig- inally justified one’s belief, one should lose confidence. Indeed, some Bayesians suggest that conditionalization should be reinterpreted as a synchronic norm as opposed to a diachronic norm in order to accommodate the epistemic significance of forgotten evidence. This dialectical situation tends to limit the effectiveness of appeals to forgotten evidence cases in arguments against current time slice epistemology. In my view, the best reason to reject the current time slice picture is provided by a different kind of case, albeit one that also exploits the fact that our memories are imperfect. In this kind of case, one arrives at a new belief as a result of temporally extended reasoning; in order to account for what one is and is not justified in believing at the end of the process, appeal must be made to historical facts about the quality of one’s reasoning at earlier stages of the process. Here is a realistic example of the kind of case that I have in mind. When I leave a gratu- ity at a restaurant, my standard, default practice is to tip 20% of the total bill as it appears on the check. Invariably, I perform the calculation as a two‐step process: first, I determine what 10% of the bill is; I then take that number and double it. There are thus three times in the process that are potentially of interest: time t 1, when I look down at the check and form the belief that the total bill is some number n (e.g., $15.50); time t 2, when I arrive at the belief that 10% of n is some second number (e.g., $1.55); and time t3, when I arrive at the belief that 20% of the total bill is some third number (e.g., $3.10). Suppose that on a given occasion I execute the procedure impeccably and arrive at the belief that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. In those circumstances, I think that we should agree that I am justified in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. That is, when I reason impeccably from a belief that I’m justified in holding by deploying my mathematical competence, this is sufficient for my being justified in holding the resulting belief, at least so long as I do not acquire any additional evidence in the interim. xi At this point, let us add another detail to the story. (Again, this detail is not a piece of philosophical fiction; rather, it is something that I take to be true of my actual practice.) my short‐term memory is sufficiently poor that, typically, by the time I arrive at the belief that 20% of the total bill is a certain number at time t 3, I no longer have the belief that I had back at time t 1, that the total bill is $n. (Imagine that you are sitting across the table from me as I perform the calculation. Immediately after I announce that “20% of the total bill is $3.10,” you ask: “How much was the total bill again?” In these circumstances, I would look back down at the check in front of me in order to answer you, as opposed to simply reporting the relevant fact from memory.) Suppose that I’m right in thinking that this is the way my beliefs evolve over time in such cases. Should that lead us to conclude that I never actually know how much 20% of the total bill is, or how much I should leave for a tip given that I want to leave 20%? I think that that would be a mistake. In a case in which I arrive at the correct answer by impec- cable mathematical reasoning, I do end up knowing how much I should leave, notwith- standing the fact that I do not retain all of the information that I utilize along the way in arriving at that number. And if I end up knowing the relevant proposition at time t3, then surely I’m justified in believing it (both propositionally and doxastically) at that time. If we accept that I’m justified in believing the target proposition when everything goes well (call this “The Good Case”), then what would undermine current time slice epistemology is 58 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE an example in which I end up not justified in believing that same proposition, but where I otherwise have the same “current time slice profile” at time t 3 (Call it “The Bad Case”). Is there a case that satisfies these requirements? I believe that there is. In order to facilitate com- parison, I present the two cases in successive tables below. In each table, the sentences without asterisks are stipulations about what is true in the relevant fiction. Assuming that the basic description of the case is coherent, these claims are trivially true, as they are built into the description itself. On the other hand, the asterisked sentences are put forward as substantive epistemological claims about what is true in the fiction, given these explicitly stipulated facts, as well as natural background assumptions about the case. In principle, a proponent of cur- rent time slice epistemology might take issue with any of these asterisked claims – although of course, some might seem like more inviting targets than others. The Good Case Time t 1 I look down at the check immediately in front of me and see that it says that the total bill is $15.50. I thus know that the total bill is $15.50. Time t2 Reasoning from my knowledge that the total bill is $15.50, I competently deduce that 10% of the total bill is $1.55. *I am justified (both propositionally and doxastically) in believing that 10% of the total bill is $1.55. Time t3 Reasoning from my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55, I competently deduce that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. *I am justified (both propositionally and doxastically) in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. I no longer hold a belief about the amount of the total bill. The Bad Case Time t1 I look down at the check immediately in front of me and see that it says that the total bill is $13.50. I thus know that the total bill is $13.50. Time t2 Reasoning from my knowledge that the total bill is $13.50, I mistakenly conclude that 10% of the total bill is $1.55. *I am not justified (either propositionally or doxastically) in believing that 10% of the total bill is $1.55. Time t3 Reasoning from my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55, I competently deduce that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. *I am not justified (either propositionally or doxastically) in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. I no longer hold a belief about the amount of the total bill. my own view is that the possibility of constructing pairs of cases of this kind amounts to a vindication of Goldman’s claim: current time slice theories of epistemic justification are ultimately untenable. How might the current time slice theorist attempt to resist this H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 59 conclusion? It seems as though there are three main strategies that she might pursue: (1) Argue that one ends up justified in both cases; (2) Argue that one ends up unjustified in both cases; (3) Argue that the intuitive verdict that one ends up justified in the Good Case and unjustified in the Bad Case is actually compatible with current time slice episte- mology. I will conclude by addressing each of these strategies, and explaining why I do not find any of them promising. Consider first the possibility of maintaining that I am justified in both cases. The burden of this strategy is to make it plausible that I end up justified in believing the target proposition in the Bad Case, despite the badness of my reasoning and the fact that there is no legitimate route to belief in that proposition from the information with which I was provided. let’s focus on the Bad Case then, and what the current time slicer might say about it. It would not be promising for the current time slicer to contest the judgment that I am not justified in believing the intermediate claim that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 at time t2. After all, it is built into the description of the case that at time t2 I still know/have not yet forgotten that the total bill is $13.50. At this point then, the falsity of the claim that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 is entailed by what I know to be true. Given the minimal assumption that one is not justified in believing propositions whose falsity is entailed by things that one knows to be true, it follows immediately that I am not justified in believing the intermediate claim that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 at time t 2. For the same reason, if (counterfactually) I had managed to retain my knowledge that the total bill is $13.50 throughout the entire process, then I would not be justified in believing the target propo- sition that 20% of the total bill is $3.10 at time t 3, for the falsity of that proposition is also entailed by what I know to be true. The current time slicer then, should insist that I end up justified in believing the target proposition at time t3 in the Bad Case because I have forgotten the information that I recently knew; at the later time t3, it is no longer true that I know something that entails the falsity of the target proposition, and it is this which makes the crucial difference to my being justified in believing it. However, this suggestion is at least initially puzzling. Why should the mere forgetting of information that entailed the falsity of the target proposition render me justified in believing it? After all, merely losing the conclusive reason against the proposition that I possessed a moment ago does not amount to gaining any reason or evidence in its favor. At this point, it seems that there are two possible stories that might be told by the current time slicer who seeks to defend the idea that one ends up justified in the Bad Case. (1) According to the first story, the fact that I end up justified in believing the target proposition at time t3 in the Bad Case is not a matter of my having some positive reason or evidence to think that it is true at that time; rather I end up justified in holding the belief simply because this is the belief at which I have arrived, and I have by this time ceased to have any evidence against it (cf. Harman 1986). The thought here is that our beliefs are “innocent until proven guilty”; a belief that one holds is prima facie justified, even in the absence of supporting reasons or evidence. The significance of my forgetting the informa- tion that entails the falsity of my belief is to remove a consideration that would have defeated my prima facie justification for believing the proposition at time t 3. I thus end up justified in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10, despite the fact that there was no legitimate route to this conclusion from my starting point. 60 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE Although this “conservative” view of belief revision would save current time slice epistemology if it were true, it is too permissive to be acceptable. xii For example, I cur- rently possess overwhelming evidence that I do not have an exceptionally good singing voice. On anyone’s view, if I nevertheless believe that I have an exceptionally good singing voice in the face of this overwhelming evidence, my belief is unjustified. On the current view, however, if I were to lose track of this evidence while continuing to hold the belief, then this would be enough for me to be fully justified in believing that I have an excep- tionally good singing voice, notwithstanding the fact that I have never had any reason at all to think anything like this. But surely that’s incorrect. Perhaps we can agree that my belief is less irrational after I lose the overwhelming evidence against it. But even if that much is conceded, it falls well short of the claim that I could become fully justified in holding the belief simply in virtue of forgetting the evidence against it, which is what is required if the view is to save current time slice epistemology. We should thus set aside this “conservative” defense of current time slice epistemology. (2) Consider then a second model that the current time slicer might propose of how in the Bad Case my forgetting the fact that the total bill is $13.50 by time t3 results in my being justified in believing the target proposition. On this alternative model, I do end up with good reason to believe the target proposition at time t3: it is not a matter of the belief ’s being “innocent until proven guilty”. Rather, the epistemic significance of my forgetting the information that entailed the falsity of the target proposition is that, once this information is removed from my total evidence via this process, my total evidence supports the target proposition. I am now justified in believing the target proposition on the basis of reasons which would have been defeated had I not forgotten the information that I possessed at the beginning of the process. This response requires that I do have evidence or a good reason to believe the target proposition (that 20% of the total bill is $3.10) at time t3. What could that reason be? A natural answer is this: my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55, from which the target proposition follows. On this view, I am justified in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10 at time t3 because this proposition follows from my current belief that 10% of the total bill $1.55, along with the fact that I have by then ceased to have any reason that suggests that it is false. One virtue of this proposal is my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 really does seem to stand in the right kind of relation to the proposition that 20% of the total bill is $3.10 to count as a reason for it. However, this proposal is embar- rassed by the current time slicer’s lack of any good story about why my intermediate belief that 10% of the total bill is 1.55 would itself be justified at time t3. And it does seem like I must be at least justified in believing that 10% of the total bill is $1.55, if this belief is to play the role of a normative reason or evidence that justifies me in believing that 20% of the bill is $3.10.xiii After all, if my belief that 10% of the total bill is unjustified, then the mere fact that it entails the target proposition would presumably not be enough to justify me in believing that proposition. (It is not the case that I have a good reason to believe anything that is entailed by some irrational or unjustified belief that I hold.) Recall that in the fiction my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 derived from a belief that did not support it (and in fact, entailed its falsity); in any event, the belief from which it is derived is not one that I retain at time t3, and so it not H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 61 something that could play a justifying role by the current time slicer’s own lights. It seems then that the current time slicer will have to insist that my belief that 10% of the total bill is $1.55 is justified at time t3 merely in virtue of the fact that by that time I have lost any reason to think that it is false, as opposed to actually having some reason for thinking that it is true. Thus, this route ultimately leads back to the kind of con- servatism about belief revision that we considered above, and which we found good reason to reject. When it comes to performing relatively trivial calculations like the one described here, I am highly reliable, although fallible. On those relatively infrequent occasions when I do miscalculate, do I have any evidence that the answer at which I arrive is the correct answer? Yes, I do. In particular, I know that I am generally competent or reliable when it comes to this kind of calculation. Given this background knowledge, the fact that I have arrived at a certain answer is some evidence that that answer is correct. (Of course, in a case of miscalculation, the evidence in question is misleading, but misleading evidence is evidence.) The current time slicer might thus offer the following story about why I end up justified in the Bad Case: What I am justified in believing at time t 3 is a matter of the total evidence that I have at time t3. But by then, I have forgotten the evidence that I once had that entailed the falsity of the answer at which I have arrived. On the other hand, I do have evidence that suggests that the answer at which I have arrived is correct, viz. my knowledge that I am generally reliable or competent when it comes to solving problems of this type, or that I typically arrive at the correct answer in relevantly similar situations. Thus, what evidence I have at time t3 supports the belief at which I arrive in the Bad Case, and this is why I am justified in believing that $3.10 is 20% of the total bill in the Bad Case. more generally, in both the Good Case and the Bad Case, by the time t3 rolls around the evidence that I am left with consists of my knowl- edge that I am generally reliable or competent when it comes to this kind of calculation, or that I typically arrive at the correct answer in relevantly similar situations. And this is why the two cases are on a par, notwithstanding the (purely historical, and therefore irrelevant) differences in the quality of my reasoning in the two cases. In my judgment, this is the best response available to the current time slicer. nevertheless, I do not think that it is ultimately persuasive. notice that on this view, the fact that I end up justified in the Good Case has nothing to do with the correctness of my reasoning; rather, as in the Bad Case, it is a matter of my having evidence to the effect that I am generally good at the relevant kind of reasoning. Suppose then that we stipu- late that I do not possess such evidence at time t3. Given that stipulation, the current time slicer who endorses the present line of thought will maintain that I end up unjusti- fied in both the Good Case and the Bad Case. The burden of this view is to make it plau- sible that I am unjustified in the Good Case (when I lack higher order evidence of my own reliability), despite the impeccable character of my reasoning. The present response thus conflicts with the intuitive thought endorsed above, viz. that when I reason impec- cably from things that I know to be true, this is sufficient for my being justified in believing the answer at which I arrive (so long as I do not acquire evidence against that answer along the way). 62 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE On the current view, I end up unjustified in the Good Case in the absence of evidence of my own reliability, notwithstanding the correctness of my reasoning, and even if the correctness of that reasoning is not at all accidental, but due to my own underlying mathematical competence. Rather, what is required for me to be justified is that I satisfy a certain higher order requirement: that of having evidence of my own reliability or competence when it comes to problems of the relevant kind. But this is a spurious requirement. Certainly, we do not hold other ways of arriving at beliefs to the same standard. For example, given sufficiently good viewing conditions, a young child can see that (and therefore, be justified in believing that) someone is at the front door, even if she lacks evidence that she is a reliable perceiver in such circumstances. Given that when things go well sense perception can deliver justified beliefs even if the perceiver lacks evidence that she is reliable in the circumstances, why can’t impeccable reasoning deliver justified beliefs, even if the reasoner lacks evidence that she is reliable in the circumstances? There is, I think, no good answer to this question. Epistemologists who theorize about justification take it to be among the most funda- mental concepts of epistemic evaluation and appraisal. It would be at least somewhat surprising, I think, if this fundamental epistemic concept carved things up in a way that did not discriminate between the situation that one ends up in in the Good Case and the situation that one ends up in in the Bad Case, given the paradigmatically good reasoning that is characteristic of the former and the paradigmatically bad reasoning that is charac- teristic of the latter. Indeed, we might offer the following the speculation: a theorist whose account of justification leads him to lump the Good Case and the Bad Case together in this way will come under theoretical pressure to introduce another term of epistemic appraisal – call it “justification*” – which does discriminate between them. After all, the distinction between the situation that one ends up in as result of good reasoning and the situation that one ends up in as a result of bad reasoning is surely one that epistemology has an interest in marking. But of course, questions might then emerge about whether this putatively new notion of justification* has a better claim to being the notion in which we were interested all along. Thus far, we have assumed that the current time slicer will maintain that I end up either justified or unjustified in both the Good Case and the Bad Case. But the unattrac- tiveness of such a stance might lead the current time slicer to revisit the idea that this is actually a commitment of her view. How might the current time slicer try to accommodate the intuitive verdict that one is justified in the Good Case but unjustified in the Bad Case? Perhaps as follows. Suppose that the current time slicer agrees that, given that my reason- ing is impeccable in the Good Case, I end up knowing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10. On the other hand, I obviously do not end up knowing this proposition in the Bad Case, since it is not true. If we understand the issue as about what I am propositionally justified in believing at time t 3 in the two cases, then the current time slicer might claim that (1) in the Good Case, I am propositionally justified in believing that 20% of the total bill is $3.10 in virtue of the current time slice fact that I know that the total bill is $3.10 at that same time, but that (2) in the Bad Case, I am not propositionally justified in believing that proposition at time t 3, precisely because the relevant proposition is not among the things that I then know. In this way, the current time slicer might insist that her view is actually H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE 63 consistent with the intuitive verdict that what I am justified in believing differs in the Good Case and the Bad Case. This route thus leads back to the kind of broadly Williamsonian “knowledge first” view considered in section 2 above. As before, I believe that a view along these lines at best preserves the letter of current time slice epistemology as opposed to its spirit, inasmuch as it allows facts about what one is justified in believing now to ultimately depend on his- torical facts about the quality of one’s past reasoning. For this reason, even if it turned out that a view along these lines were correct, I do not believe that this would constitute a vindication of current time slice epistemology over the historical approach as it has been pioneered by Goldman and others. Quite independently of that point, however, it seems that the specific proposal floated here – which appeals to a difference in what one ends up knowing in the Good Case and the Bad Case – is insufficient for the current time slicer’s purposes. For we can alter the example slightly, so that one ends up knowing in neither the Good Case nor the Bad Case, while preserving the intuition that one is justified in the Good Case but not in the Bad Case. For example, suppose that in the Good Case, although I reason impeccably from the information provided to me, that information was subtly inaccu- rate, in a way that I could not have been expected to notice. (Perhaps I was very slightly overcharged for one of the items, and the waiter is about to hand me an amended check which shows a slightly different total.) In that case, I do not end up knowing that 20% of my total bill is $3.10, because it is not true that 20% of my total bill is $3.10. nevertheless, given that I reason impeccably from information that I had every reason to think accurate, I end up justified (both propositionally and doxastically) in the Good Case, until the waiter informs me of the restaurant’s mistake. The Bad Case is as before; the case for thinking that I am unjustified in those circumstances is thus as strong as ever. Thus, in this variant of the original example, there is no possibility that the differ- ence in what I end up justified in believing in the Good Case and the Bad Case is underwritten by a difference in what I know at that time. Therefore, an appeal to “knowledge first” epistemology does not seem to help the current time slicer with her problems involving reasoning over time. In this section, I have argued that a certain kind of case involving temporally extended reasoning gives us good reason to reject current time slice accounts of epistemic justifica- tion. moreover, examples like the one discussed here are ones that process reliabilists should find congenial, inasmuch as one natural way of accounting for the seeming epis- temic difference between the Good Case and the Bad Case is in terms of the difference in reliability of the belief‐forming processes employed in the two cases. While I do not think that examples of this type support process reliabilism over every other historical theory of justification, I do think that they suggest that some historical theory or other must be correct. At the outset of this paper, I registered my opinion that Goldman’s “What is justified belief?” stands as one of the great papers of twentieth century epistemology. notoriously, many “great works of philosophy” generate little enthusiasm, even among their admirers, for the project of defending any of their central claims as straightforwardly true. In this case, however, I believe that at least one of Goldman’s central themes – the historicity of justification – is simply correct.xiv 64 H IST ORICA l v ERS u S Cu RRE n T T I m E Sl ICE Notes i On this point, I follow Hedden (2015) and moss (2015). ii notice that here moss employs the term “rationality” and its cognates while I (following the lead of Goldman) have used the term “justification” and its cognates. Someone might try to make something of this, but I won’t. iii To be clear, I don’t put this forward as an objection to Goldman. As indicated, this and many of his other remarks about the distinction seem to be put forward in the spirit of informal, heuris- tic remarks that are intended to get the reader to grasp an intuitive distinction, a purpose which (at least to my mind) they effectively serve. my current point is simply that this informal gloss is not promising when taken as a theoretically adequate account of the distinction itself. iv Although Williamson (2000) generally eschews talk of “justification,” the view defended there is otherwise a good example of the kind of view that I have in mind. v The recent literature on grounding is voluminous; for an account of the notion that I found congenial, see Rosen (2010). vi In Goldman’s terminology, this corresponds to the distinction between ex post and ex ante justification. vii For example, this is true of the passage from Conee and Feldman quoted earlier. viii Compare the treatments in Goldman (1979: 41–2; 2009: 107; 2011: 136–7). ix notably, the thought is a major theme in the epistemological work of Gilbert Harman, and serves as the primary motivation for his “conservatism” about belief revision. See especially Harman (1984, 1986). I briefly discuss Harman’s conservatism in section 4. x “now the vast preponderance of things we know at a given time depends for their justifiedness on the rightness of a rule like (Pm). This holds especially for items of knowledge stored in mem- ory. moreover, stored knowledge constitutes the great bulk of our knowledge, because there are narrow limits to the number of things held in consciousness at any given moment…It is highly like that almost all justified stored beliefs depend for their justifiedness on (Pm)” (2009: 110). xi Perhaps if someone sitting across the table attempts the same calculation but announces a dif- ferent answer, or if I suddenly acquire evidence that I recently ingested a drug that makes me unreliable at such calculations, then the mere fact that I performed the calculation impeccably would not be sufficient for me to be justified in believing the answer at which I arrive. But in the more boring, humdrum example on which I will focus, nothing like this occurs. notice that the current time slice theorist can consistently agree that having reasoned impeccably from a justified belief is sufficient (in the absence of defeating evidence) for being justified at the later time, because the sufficiency claim is consistent with both the superveni- ence and grounding claims described above. xii Here I follow most of those who have addressed the issue, including many who are friendly to current time slice epistemology. See especially Christensen (1994) and Feldman (1989). xiii A significant number of philosophers hold that a proposition p can be a justifying reason or evidence for a subject S only if S knows that p. But that claim is controversial. The argument in the text relies on a much weaker assumption, viz. that a proposition p is a normative or justifying reason for S only if S is justified in believing p. xiv Some of the ideas in this chapter were presented in colloquium talks at the university of Pittsburgh, the university of Texas at Austin, and the university of miami; in keynote addresses at the 2014 Rochester Graduate Epistemology Conference and the 2015 Formal Epistemology Workshop; at the 2014 Chambers Conference at the university of nebraska at lincoln; and at a marc Sanders Seminar at Rutgers university.

One of the liveliest debates in epistemology of the last 30–40 years is the one between internalism and externalism. Reliabilism has played a large role in this debate because it is a conspicuous form of externalism. Reliabilism’s classification as an externalist theory derives partly from its thesis that a belief ’s justificational status hinges on the truth‐ conduciveness of the process that produces it. Truth‐conduciveness is a paradigm example of an external factor. But certain forms of reliabilism are externalist for an additional reason. Internalism holds that a belief ’s justificational status depends exclusively on facts obtaining at the time of belief. By contrast, one form of reliabilism, that is, historical relia- bilism (Goldman 1979; 1999; 2009), rejects this “current time‐slice” view. The present volume is fortunate to have three first‐rate epistemologists devoting either their entire contribution (Kelly; mcGrath) or a good chunk of their chapter (BonJour) to this debate between the traditional current‐time‐slice approach and the historical approach. Thomas Kelly’s paper is divisible into three main parts. The first makes valuable clarifications in the formulation of the current‐time‐slice theory and its historical rival. Kelly advances CTS‐Grounding (CTS‐G) (see below) as the best formulation of the current‐time‐slice theory: (CTS‐G) Facts about what S is justified in believing at time t are ultimately grounded in a set of non‐historical facts. A current‐time‐slice theorist is anyone who accepts CTS‐G; a historical theorist is anyone who rejects it. Reply to Kelly REP l Y T O KE ll Y 67 A second part of the paper (per my division) contains two original arguments by Kelly against CTS‐G. The first is an argument from “proper basing.” The second is an inven- tive argument featuring extended reasoning over time. In the third part of the paper Kelly reviews my preservative memory principle for the historical view, but also identifies a problem with it. I find both of Kelly’s new arguments for the historical theory completely convincing. The first begins by reminding us that doxastic justifiedness of a belief depends on whether it is properly based on the evidence in one’s possession. However, the leading accounts of the basing relation typically feature a causal requirement: that the belief be caused by (possession of) the pertinent evidence. Given that causes typically precede their effects, the doxastic justifiedness of a belief will typically depend on events prior to the moment of belief. This is compatible only with the historical theory, not the current‐ time‐slice theory. Kelly’s second new argument pertains to the justificational status of a belief arrived at by several steps of reasoning. To account for what one is justified in believing at the end of the process, appeal must be made to historical facts about the quality of reasoning at earlier stages of the process. This is another clever and compelling argument. I turn finally to Kelly’s exposition and critique of my own defense of the historical theory by appeal to preservative memory and forgotten evidence. As he indicates, I argued that no current‐time‐slice‐ theory can do justice to the epistemic role of memory. Suppose that, at some time to, one is justified in believing proposition P on the basis of strong evidence. Over time one forgets the original evidence while still retaining the belief via (preservative) memory. no acceptable epistemological theory, Kelly argues, would require one to give up a belief successfully retained via memory merely because one has lost the evidence of its truth at the later time. In (Goldman 2009) I have proposed a principle that governs this kind of case: (Pm) If S has a justified attitude D toward proposition P at t, and if S retains attitude D toward P until the later time t’, via memory, then ceteris paribus, S is still permitted [justi- fied] in having attitude D toward P at t’. Kelly, however, produces his “graduate student address” counterexample to this princi- ple. While in his second year of graduate school, S has overwhelming evidence that he lives at such‐and‐such an address. He is extremely confident of this proposition, and is presumably justified in this confidence. After years elapse, however, S loses whatever evidence he once had for this proposition. But suppose he retains that (address) proposi- tion in memory, and believes it. Is he justified in being every bit as confident as he ever was? This is what principle Pm suggests; but Kelly contends that this is the wrong result. (BonJour says the same thing in his contribution.) losing evidence should make at least some difference, even when one’s memory sustains the original belief. I am now inclined to concede the point. But this in no way undercuts the historical theory. One simply needs to tweak principle Pm a bit so as to require agents to restrict their confidence to lower levels (as I explain below). It will still be true that the original evidence continues to have some force or impact on the justificational status of the later 68 REP l Y T O KE ll Y belief. Epistemologists don’t need more than this to warrant the rejection of the current‐ time‐slice principle. Why exactly does Pm need tweaking? At least partly, I would submit, because of memory’s fallibility. The later output of semantic memory does not always match the inputs to it, so its conditional reliability is far from perfect. Generally speaking, the longer the elapsed time between an original encoding of a memory content and a subsequent memory content that derives from that encoding, the greater the proneness to error. An improved form of principle Pm, therefore, would include a qualification that permits only lower levels of credence than were warranted by the original evidence. In other words, justifica- tional “decay” kicks in; so that the amount of justificational support that originates from early evidence gradually ebbs or recedes (without, perhaps, ever dropping to zero). Even without new evidence, a retained belief ’s justifiedness might slowly ebb so that increas- ingly lower levels of credence are warranted. Even such a modified principle will be flatly incompatible with the internalist principle CTS‐G, which rejects any justificational impact by earlier evidence. Thus, the historical theory would still be ratified by even a weakened form of principle Pm. References Goldman, A. (1979) What is justified belief?. In: Pappas, G. (ed.)

The Justification of Memory Beliefs Evidentialism, Reliabilism, Conservatism M a T T h E w M c G R a T h 4 According to internalism about justification, what a subject is justified in believing is fixed by factors internal to the subject. To put it more carefully: necessarily, if subjects are identical with respect to internal factors at a time, they are identical with respect to what they are justified in believing at that time. i For Conee and Feldman (2001), Goldman’s long‐time internalist opponents, the sort of internality involved is mentality. They label this internalism mentalism. The particular form of mentalism they recommend is mentalist evidentialism. On this view, a subject is justified in believing p at a time just in case believing that p fits the evidence the subject has at that time, where facts about whether believing that p fits a subject’s evidence at a time are fixed by the subject’s mental states at the time.ii Mentalist evidentialism nicely accommodates a broad range of cases as well as having considerable intuitive appeal as a general principle.iii On traditional “narrow” conceptions of the mental, mentalistic evidentialism is incon- sistent with Goldman’s (1979) original process reliabilist theory of justification. According to such conceptions of the mental, one’s mental states could have been just as they are even if one fails ever to perceive or know about physical objects in one’s environment. Each of us has some possible mental twin who is a brain in a vat (BIV). Goldman’s original process reliabilism holds, roughly, that a belief is justified just in case it is reliably produced. Or more carefully: a belief is justified just in case it is either produced by a reli- able belief‐independent process or it is the product of conditionally reliable belief‐dependent processes ultimately originating in beliefs produced by reliable belief‐independent processes.iv We can see how, given the traditional conception of the mental, mentalistic 70 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s evidentialism is incompatible with reliabilism. For, suppose the traditional conception is correct and that mentalistic evidentialism is true. Then each of us has a BIV who is a mental twin, and by mentalistic evidence a justificatory twin. But in the BIV perceptual belief‐forming processes are unreliable whereas ours are reliable. It follows that reliabilism is false. In this chapter, I will follow Conee and Feldman in assuming this traditional conception of the mental. Thus, I will take it that mentalistic evidentialism is inconsistent with process reliabilism. Because of the appeal of mentalistic evidentialism (hereafter simply “evidentialism”), and its inconsistency with process reliabilism, it is small wonder Goldman spends consid- erable energy attacking it over the years. In this chapter, I consider one of Goldman’s principal attacks, the argument that evidentialism cannot account for the justification of our memory beliefs.v Our concern throughout is with what psychologists after Tulving (1972) call semantic rather than episodic memory. Episodic memory, according to Tulving, is a capacity to remember particular events. It has a quasi‐perceptual character: one in some sense “replays” certain experiences one had or at least seems to have had previously. he calls it a kind of “mental time travel.” vi Beliefs can be formed on the basis of episodic memory. I might remember yesterday’s hike and come to believe that, yes, it was low tide, even though at the time I didn’t think at all about the tide at the time. semantic memory, by contrast, is understood as our capacity for maintaining information about the world, with information understood broadly enough to include misinformation  –  false beliefs. semantic memory does not depend on any replaying of experience. In recalling that the battle of hastings occurred in 1066 one need not replay the experience one had of learn- ing this from a teacher or in a book. Goldman’s critique of evidentialism concerns beliefs retained in semantic memory rather than beliefs formed, reaffirmed, or sustained by episodic memory. vii I will not try to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a belief to count as retained through semantic memory. Paradigm examples are memories of humdrum facts not at all about oneself, but about history, geography, language, science or mathematics, memories that when recollected are not associated with mental time travel. For instance, consider your memories that the battle of hastings was in 1066, that Boise is the capital of Idaho, and that the roman term for scotland was “Caledonia.” Again, though, semantic memo- ries needn’t be true. For a substantial period of my life, sadly, I had a memory belief that there were three Peloponnesian wars. viii The plan for this chapter is as follows: section 1 examines Goldman’s critique of evi- dentialism’s account of the justification of memory beliefs; section 2 discusses a problem for Goldman’s own reliabilist account of memory beliefs; section 3 distinguishes two sorts of epistemic status at issue and not usually clearly separated in these debates, historical justification vs. justification to retain a belief; section 4 raises doubts about the resources of reliabilism for explaining justification to retain beliefs; and finally section 5 makes a plea for a less ambitious account of justification to retain beliefs, a restricted form of epis- temic conservatism. I argue that the conservative account I recommend represents a kind of neutral baseline, insofar as there are both reliabilist‐friendly as well as evidentialist‐ friendly arguments for it. T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 71 1 Goldman’s Challenge: The Problem of Forgotten Evidence In the case of justified beliefs based on episodic memory, the evidentialist can appeal to the quasi‐perceptual conscious episodes of recollection as the evidence rendering the belief justified. however, as Goldman has keenly observed in numerous writingsix, matters are different for semantic memory. here it is not as easy to find the needed evidence. There need be no quasi‐perceptual replaying of experience. Moreover, the original evidence one relied on in forming the belief often seems to be long ago forgotten. And yet it would be absurd to think that beliefs such as my belief or yours that The Badlands are in South Dakota are unjustified. so here is Goldman’s challenge to the evidentialist: in para- digm cases of justified memory beliefs like The Badlands are in South Dakota, identify the evidence the subject currently possesses that makes her justified. If there is no such evi- dence to be found, this is a strong reason to reject evidentialism. This is the so‐called problem of forgotten evidence for evidentialism. Importantly, we are often very well justified in our memory beliefs, even when we have forgotten our original evidence. It is therefore not enough for the evidentialist to find some evidence; the evidence must be strong enough to ground our high degree of justification. It seems difficult for the evidentialist to solve the problem of forgotten evidence unless she takes either nondoxastic conscious episodes of recollection or the fact that one has a certain semantic memory as providing the needed evidence. Consider other sources of evi- dence. A subject might well lack her original evidence, of course. Granted, a subject might know that she is usually right in her beliefs about such‐and‐such subject matter. But it is not clear that this consideration provides strong enough evidence to make her as well justified as she is in a particular belief about that subject matter. And what of cases in which a subject knows just a bit about the subject matter? Moreover, how exactly does she know the propo- sition that she is usually right in her beliefs about this subject matter? Is it itself a justified memory belief? What justifies it? One could know this without having examples of being right readily available to memory. What would the evidence for it be? The evidentialist might hope to find the needed evidence in memories related in content to the target memory. For instance, you might remember not only that the Battle of hastings occurred in 1066 but also that William the Conqueror led the normans in that fight. however, the associated memories, while they might provide some support, do not provide enough. Does the fact that William the Conqueror led the fight strongly support the belief that the battle occurred in 1066, rather than say, 1065? Experts on the norman invasion might know enough of the details to have strongly supporting evidence for 1066. An ordinary person, such as myself, typically lacks this knowledge and yet is still very well‐justified. There is other evidence, of course: I’ve often heard from reputable sources that 1066 is the date of that battle. This is good support. But some well‐justified memory beliefs might not have this support, for example, my belief that I had a childhood friend named “Amy.” But again, a further question arises even when we do have the evidence of having heard that many times: what is the justification of that belief? One can be justified without recalling episodes in which one has heard it. Where else to look, then, if not to nondoxastic episodes of recollection or to the fact that one holds the relevant memory belief? Evidentialists have typically not wanted to appeal to the latter, though, as it seems to bring in its wake epistemic conservatism. Is the 72 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s fact that I have the belief that p evidence for me that p? Even if it is some evidence, is it strong enough? Issues with basing also arise. Do I re‐base my memory belief on a belief about my currently holding it? If not, is this evidence I have but do not use as a basis for belief? Does it make no difference to ex post justification of memory beliefs (that is, to the status of memory beliefs as justified) as opposed to their ex ante justification (that is, to the status of the relevant proposition being justified for one)? x To avoid these sorts of con- cerns, evidentialists prefer to appeal to episodes of recollection as evidence. Perhaps it isn’t implausible to think that we do base (re‐base?) our memory beliefs on these episodes, and they might well seem to be evidence, perhaps good evidence. Philosophers use various labels for these episodes: “memory impressions,” “seeming to remember,” “apparent memories.” xi But what exactly are these? Again, we should not con- flate semantic with episodic memory. These are not quasi‐perceptual states that take time to unfold, in which one replays an experience or sequence of experiences. Are these recollec- tions feelings of certain sorts? If so, they are feelings that “assert” the truth of their content. They are feelings that are correct if one does remember that p and incorrect otherwise. Are they broadly doxastic phenomena? If so, do they admit of justification themselves? let’s suppose the evidentialist can give us an adequate account of what recollections are, one that doesn’t make them eligible for justificatory status but which also doesn’t conflate them with the “mental time travel” involved in recollecting episodic memories. still, there is another problem waiting in the wings, what Goldman (1999: 278) calls the problem of stored beliefs. A belief such as The Badlands are in South Dakota is justified whether or not one is thinking or judging or otherwise occurrently holding it. Even when the belief is non‐occurrent it is justified. But when it is non‐occurrent, there simply isn’t an episode of the right sort of recollection concerning the proposition that The Badlands are in South Dakota. One can perhaps be said to recollect that p when one is disposed upon considering whether p to undergo the relevant recollection. But can this mere disposition justify the belief? As Goldman (278–9) points out, being disposed to have evidence is not sufficient for actually having evidence. A train passenger just about to awake from his nap has a disposi- tion to have evidence about the landscape out the window, but having not opened his eyes he has no evidence about it. nor, we might add, does a brilliant mathematician who has the disposition to enjoy a clear intuition that would justify him in believing that a certain equa- tion has a solution thereby have evidence that the equation has a solution. In their 2001 paper, Conee and Feldman reply that not just any disposition to acquire evidence is itself evidence the person has. rather, “some non‐occurrent states that one is already in, such as non‐occurrent memories of perceptual experiences, are stored evidence” (8). however, one needn’t have memories of perceptual experiences associated with the memory belief. More recently, they claim that the disposition to recollect is itself evidence the subject has, but they don’t explain how (2011: 302). Even granting that the occurrent state of recollection is evidence, why is the disposition to enjoy this evidence also evidence? Even if it is, though, do we base our memory beliefs on it? If not, does this evidence not matter to doxastic justification but only to propositional justification? Or should the standard assumption that doxastic justification requires proper basing be given up? The evidentialist thus faces a difficult set of problems. she must show us how to solve the problem of forgotten evidence while not wrecking her ship on the problem of stored T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 73 beliefs. The only way to do so, it appears, is for her to argue that dispositions to enjoy recollections are themselves the evidence on the basis of which we are justified in our memory beliefs. But it is far from clear how these dispositions are evidence and how they can make a difference to the ex post justification of our memory beliefs. This set of problems is not obviously insurmountable. But I think it is clear that Goldman has shown that the evidentialist must do some hard work to explain how they can meet the two‐pronged challenge posed by the problem of forgotten evidence and the problem of stored beliefs – work they have yet to do. By contrast, compare Goldman’s process reliabilism. On this view, there is no problem of forgotten evidence and no prob- lem of stored beliefs. Is a memory belief justified? To answer this, look to see if it is formed through a conditionally reliable memory process the input to which was a newly formed belief that is reliably formed. If the process simply preserves beliefs with their content, then it is conditionally reliable; and therefore, so long as one’s belief was justified when formed, and so long as one lacks defeaters, the retained belief, too, is justified, indepen- dently of whether the belief happens to be occurrent. This is a simple and attractive account, starkly contrasting with the daunting challenge facing the evidentialist. 2 A Challenge to Reliabilism: “Bad” Memory Cases so far, so good for reliabilism. however, a certain sub‐class of forgotten evidence cases raises difficulties for Goldman’s own reliabilism, namely the sub‐class of memory beliefs that were originally formed on the basis of poor evidence, now forgotten, and which now appear to the subject simply to be things she remembers. Call these “bad” forgotten evidence cases or simply “bad memory cases.” suppose you trusted a friend you knew you had reason not to trust on a certain question, for example, some piece of scottish history (e.g., that Mary Queen of scots was under house arrest in st Andrews for a period). you knew the friend liked to present himself as knowledgeable, despite his relative ignorance of scottish history. nonetheless, you formed the belief. now, you’ve forgotten the poor source. The belief is stored at the time. Perhaps you have a disposition to enjoy a recollec- tion if you were to think about where Mary Queen of scots was imprisoned, but again it is hard to see how such a disposition could help justify. surely, it is reasonable for you to retain your belief about Mary and st Andrews. It would make little sense to give it up. yes, retaining the belief would be bad in some ways. you would have a false belief, for one thing, although this is an inessential feature of the case. you would also have an ignorant belief, an unreliable belief, an unsafe belief, etc. All true. But you have no idea of any of that, nor should you – it’s just a feature of our beliefs that we tend to forget our original evidence for them. It seems clear that the reasonable option is to keep the belief, not give it up. It’s not merely that you have an excuse. It would be positively unreasonable not to keep the belief. Might bad memory cases be cases in which all options – belief, disbelief, and suspen- sion of belief – are unreasonable? This would have to be argued, and the prospects do not look bright. One would have to argue that there is no reasonable stance to take in such cases, which seems problematic once we consider, for instance, the role of belief in action. Consider the Mary/st Andrews case. you’re offered a bet on whether Mary Queen of 74 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s scots was imprisoned in st Andrews: if it’s true you get $100; it is false you lose $100. Is this a hitherto unrecognized class of prohibition dilemmas,xii that is, situations in which each available option is prohibited? This is hard to believe. so, it appears that in bad memory cases the subject is justified in retaining the belief. Moreover, the subject seems exactly as well justified in retaining the belief in the good as in the bad cases. should you have a lower credence for Mary was in St Andrews than you have for Mary was in Jedburgh (another fact you “just remember,” this time from reading a tour guide)? 3 Justificatory Statuses I can imagine some philosophers shaking (not nodding!) their heads vigorously while reading the previous section. Forming an unjustified belief then forgetting your bad rea- sons and later simply seeing the belief as something you remember can’t leave you with a justified belief! These philosophers will think that unlike Goldman’s case against eviden- tialism the case I’ve just presented against Goldman’s reliabilism has no merit at all. I fully grant that there is some good sort of epistemic status present in good memory cases but missing in bad ones. And I agree that this epistemic status cannot be identified with knowledge, because there are good cases in which it turns out that the belief is false, though justifiably formed, and so not an instance of knowledge. I agree that, finally, the epistemic status is itself a justificatory status. however, I think it is obvious that in the good and bad cases alike it is reasonable of the subject to retain the belief, and I think this itself is a justificatory status. One is every bit as justified in retaining the belief whether one is in a good or bad memory case. how can I say both that the belief in the good case has a better justificatory status than the belief in the bad case while also saying that the subjects in both cases are equally justi- fied in retaining their beliefs? I can say this because there are two justificatory statuses involved here. let me explain. One is the status of being justified in retaining a belief. If one has a belief, one can be justified in keeping it, rather than giving it up. The other is closer to what we might call the status of being a “well‐formed and well‐maintained” belief. This second status I’ll call historical justification. We can define historical justification this way: s’s belief at t is historically justified if and only if s formed her belief justifiably and if s has retained her belief over time, then s has justifiably retained her belief up to and including time t. In good but not in bad memory cases, the subject’s belief is historically justified, even though in both cases the subject is justified in retaining her belief. We should pause to address a possible worry. By calling it historical justification, we sug- gest that what we are discussing is a genuine justificational status (and we have explicitly said). Consider truth and belief. These statuses are relevant to knowledge, and so could be called “epistemic” in a thin sense; however, they lack any sort of intrinsic normativity. notions of epistemic justification, like any notion of justification in any domain, should be T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 75 normative. Is historical justification merely an epistemic status in the thin sense, or is it normative in the way genuine justificatory statuses must be? I see no reason to deny it is genuinely normative. For one thing, historical justification traces a belief over time with respect to statuses that we call all agree are normative: justified formation and justified retention. historical justification is therefore not epistemic merely in the way belief and truth are. More than this: a subject whose belief is not historically justified ought not to have had this belief and is now criticizable for having had it. The applicability of this “ought not” suggests we are dealing with genuine normativity here. so, we have two justificatory statuses, both normative, applicable to memory beliefs: historical justification and justification to retain a belief. One is justified to retain a belief just if retaining it (that is, keeping it) is justified for one. A tempting conclusion to draw at this point is that Goldman and his critics are both correct in their claims about who is “justi- fied” in various memory cases but that they are using the term to mean different things. For Goldman it means historical justification and he is correct that memory beliefs are histori- cally justified in the good but not in the bad cases even though the subjects are alike with respect to their current evidence. That he has historical justification in mind fits nicely with his claim that in the bad cases the subject’s belief lacks justification in the “epistemizing” sense, that is, in the sense of justification that “carries one a good distance toward knowl- edge” (1999: 281). historical justification does carry one farther toward knowledge than mere justification to retain a belief does. historical justification entails but is not entailed by justification to retain a belief, and historical justification is necessary for knowledge. For Conee and Feldman (and myself in section  2 above) “justified” when used to describe memory beliefs in bad cases means justification to retain the belief and we are correct that in both the good and the bad cases the subjects justified in retaining their beliefs. I think this tempting conclusion is exactly right: both Goldman and his critics are right in their claims about who is “justified” in good and bad memory cases. however, this conclusion does not close the book on further epistemological theoriz- ing. For, epistemologists ought to seek a comprehensive epistemological framework within which to explain both historical justification and justified retention. Given that historical justification is defined in terms of justified formation and justified retention, the comprehensive framework we ought to seek is one that explains justified belief retention and justified belief formation. We should demand from any epistemological view that aims to be comprehensive, such as reliabilism or evidentialism, that it explain when and why we are justified to form and to retain beliefs. My suggestions, I predict, will not come as news to Goldman. A careful reading of Goldman’s writings from 1979 on confirms that he sees things as I am suggesting they should be seen. he offers a unified reliabilist account of all these notions: justified beliefs formation, justified belief retention, and in terms of these an account of historical justifi- cation. One possible point of difference between us, I think, is that Goldman seems to think that because historical justification takes us substantially farther toward knowledge than mere justified retention it is the more important status for epistemology to explain (1999: 280–1). This is at best a minor point of difference. We agree, I believe, that the job of epistemology is to explain all epistemic normative statuses and if possible give a unified account of their conditions and interrelations. 76 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s The next section of this chapter considers whether reliabilism provides the needed comprehensive framework. Our focus is on justified retention of belief. We want to see how the reliabilist can explain this status. 4 Problems for Reliabilism about Justified Retention Goldman is characteristically sensitive to all the intuitions we have concerning all the forgot- ten evidence cases, whether the cases are of the good or bad variety. he does acknowledge that there is a kind of justification that is not so closely tied to knowledge but which is present in good and bad cases alike. And he gives a reliabilist account of it as well, which we now examine. here is Goldman: There is a variant of the historical conception of justified belief that is worth mentioning in this context. It may be introduced as follows. suppose s has a set B of beliefs at time t 0, and some of these beliefs are unjustified. Between t 0 and t 1 he reasons from the entire set B to the conclusion p, which he then accepts at t 1. The reasoning procedure he uses is a very sound one, that is, one that is conditionally reliable. There is a sense or respect in which we are tempted to say that s’s belief in p at t 1 is “justified.” At any rate, it is tempting to say that the person is justi- fied in believing that p at t. relative to his antecedent cognitive state, he did as well as could be expected: the transition from his cognitive state at t 0 to his cognitive state at t 1 was entirely sound. Although we may acknowledge this brand of justifiedness – it might be called “Terminal‐ Phase reliabilism” – it is not a kind of justifiedness so closely related to knowing… (1979: 16) The key idea here is that we may evaluate beliefs not merely according to historical justi- fication but according to the final portion of their histories. so, in the case of sound rea- soning from unjustified premises, we want to say the resulting belief  –  or better the transition – is justified, and similarly in the case of pure preservation through memory of an unjustified belief, we may say that the belief at the later time – or better the retention from the earlier to the later time – is justified. Thus, Goldman recognizes justified transitions as well as historically justified beliefs, and he provides the following reliabilist accounts: 1 To have a historically justified belief is to have a belief that is either itself formed from a reliable belief‐independent process or which is ultimately traceable through condi- tionally reliable belief‐dependent processes to beliefs formed from reliable belief‐ independent processes. (This is reliabilism). 2 To have a justified doxastic transition is to have a belief produced by a process the final phase of which is a conditionally reliable belief‐dependent process. (This is terminal‐ phase reliabilism.) As an application of (2), we have: (Reliabilism about justified retentions): to have a justified retention (from t 0 to t 1) is to retain a belief through a conditionally reliable process from t0 to t1. T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 77 Preservative memory – merely keeping the belief without basing it on new evidence – is a conditionally reliable process, and therefore we can conclude that pure memorial reten- tions are justified. Of course, all these remarks concern prima facie justificatory sta- tuses only. If you ignore defeaters, your retention is not justified, despite being conditionally reliable. Given this account of justified retentions, how can Goldman explain the status of being justified in retaining a belief? Being justified in retaining a belief is an ex ante status, as opposed to an ex post status. Goldman generally understands ex ante justification in terms of the availability of an ex post justification. We follow him on this. now, in general, it isn’t true that when one is justified at time t in retaining a belief, one has available a justified retention whose temporal extent begins before t. Perhaps before t one ignored defeaters which one now fails to remember. What is available, though, is a justified reten- tion from t to just after t. let’s call retentions available at a time to just after that time current retentions. so, if I am justified at time in retaining a belief, then available to me at that time is a justified current retention. In this way, Goldman can extend the terminal‐ phase account to apply to ex ante justification to retain beliefs (and generally to make doxastic transitions). The combination of reliabilism, terminal‐phase reliabilism, and the account of ex ante justification in terms of ex post justification promises exactly the sort of comprehensive epistemological framework we are looking for. There is no denying its unity and power. however, I think there is good reason to doubt its adequacy. here we focus on terminal‐ phase reliabilism and its associated account of justified retentions. The basic problem, I claim, is that conditional reliability is too weak a condition on the justified doxastic transitions. Conditional reliability is too weak for the same sorts of rea- sons reliability is too weak in the case of justified belief formation. Consider the following belief‐transition process: input a belief that p and output a belief that: p & the New York Yankees won the World Series in 1998. This is a condition- ally reliable process. But this mere fact does not ensure that the transition from p to p & the Yankees won the World Series in 1998 is a justified one. A reliabilist might reply that this is an artificial process, one involving explicit content‐specification. I do not see, though, why this couldn’t be a psychologically real process  –  perhaps a super‐ scientist yankees’ fan could program a believer to make this transition. Why wouldn’t it be the process the subject uses? If the reliabilist instead claims that counterfactual conditional reliability is needed, we could replace the Yankees won the World Series in 1998 with some complicated theorem of propositional logic. Again, it doesn’t seem that there is some a priori barrier to a subject using such a process. But clearly the process cannot transmit justification. The mere fact that the subject goes from the one belief to the other with the additional true conjunct just doesn’t seem to suffice for the transi- tion to be justified. This style of objection, of course, is familiar from the literature. norman the clairvoy- ant is not justified in his belief even if the process happens to be reliable. Or to use one of Goldman’s own examples, the subject in a world in which wishful thinking is reliable is not justified in his wishfully formed beliefs. It is unsurprising that the same considera- tions carry over to conditional reliability. 78 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s I don’t think for a minute that my doubts about whether conditional reliability suffices for justified doxastic transitions will trouble Goldman. The various replies he gives from 1979 on to the standard counterexamples of reliability without justified belief formations can be employed with minor changes as replies to examples of conditional reliability without justified belief transitions. he might appeal to non‐ manipulated environments, to normal worlds, or to actual‐world reliability. however, by departing from conditional reliability as sufficient for the justification of doxastic transitions we lose much of the power and unity of the view, just as we do by departing from reliability as a sufficient for the justification of beliefs formed through belief‐ independent processes. It is unclear, for instance, why conditional reliability in a manipulated environment should count less epistemically than conditional reliability in a non‐manipulated environment. surely there would have to be something else that is making the epistemic difference if there is a difference in justification of the same doxastic transition across manipulated vs. non‐manipulated environments, and not the mere fact that in one case the conditional reliability occurs in a manipulated environ- ment and in the other it doesn’t. similarly, if conditional reliability in our world has a powerful epistemic upshot, so should conditional reliability in other worlds. It cannot be a simple brute matter that conditional reliability in our world is epistemically efficacious – that it suffices for justified transitions – whereas conditional reliability in other worlds isn’t. It must hold because of something deeper. But then it can’t be con- ditional reliability that is the epistemically efficacious feature. similar considerations apply to normal worlds. Another reply Goldman makes in the face of proposed counterexamples to relia- bilism is to recast reliabilism as a theory of justification‐attributions rather than of justification itself (1979: 18). I expect he might do this when confronted with my alleged counterexamples to the reliabilist theory of justified belief retentions. I will not discuss this proposal in detail. I think that examples given in the literature concerning justified belief formation do strongly suggest that reliability is not suf- ficient for justification, and I think, similarly, my examples strongly suggest condi- tional reliability is insufficient for justified doxastic transitions. These examples support these conclusions as much as the reliabilist‐friendly examples commonly used in motivating reliabilism support the reliabilist‐friendly conclusions. Moreover, even if we put aside the project of trying to determine the conditions under which a belief formation or retention is justified and merely attempted to give an account of attributions of such statuses, I think the fact that we attribute justification to subjects in the relevant cases is prima facie grounds for a theory of justification attributions that isn’t reliabilist. After all, we are attributing justification despite the fact that the subject’s belief formation or belief retention isn’t reliable/condition- ally reliable. I do not pretend these remarks close the book on reliabilism about doxastic transitions. I will have achieved my main purpose in this section, however, if I have established that the very same sort of worries that lead people to deny that reliability is sufficient for justi- fied belief formation give us just as much reason to deny that conditional reliability is sufficient for justified retention. T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 79 5 Epistemic Conservatism In section 1, relying on Goldman’s work, we identified serious problems for the eviden- tialist account of justified belief retention. however, in section 4, we identified serious problems for the reliabilist account of justified retention. Where to turn, then? I suggest we should give epistemic conservatism a hearing. We will begin by seeing what conserva- tism can do for us, regardless of whether we accept evidentialism or reliabilism or some other fundamental epistemological framework. let’s, for the moment, back away from theories about what fundamentally makes us justified in retaining our memory beliefs and consider under what conditions we are justified in retaining them. If we can devise a good Chisholm‐style principle for memorial justification, we can then turn to the deeper questions about what makes that principle true, what more fundamental principle it can be derived from. I suggest we look to a version of epistemic conservatism. On first blush, we might think of formulating epistemic conservatism as follows: If one believes that p, then one is prima facie justified in believing that p. But recall that we are avoiding talk of what one is “justified in believing.” We instead are using the clearer language of “justified belief formation,” “justified belief retention,” and “historical justification.” so, let’s take as our first stab at a principle of epistemic conservatism about justified belief retention the following principle (cf. harman 1986): (EC) If one believes that p, then one is prima facie justified in retaining one’s belief that p. Immediately, however, we can see that (EC) needs revision before it can be plausible. As it stands, it applies to any beliefs, even ones that are newly formed. suppose I believe p on the basis of poor evidence, and so unjustifiably believe P. It shouldn’t follow that I am justified in retaining that belief in the absence of defeaters. If I unjustifiably form the belief that rochester days are usually sunny based on its being sunny the day I pass through the town, then if I don’t realize my mistake or learn of any counterevidence I’m not thereby justified in retaining that belief. We need to restrict its scope. We should at least restrict the scope of the principle to memory beliefs. however, even this still seems too broad. some memory beliefs are based on other memory beliefs. If one memory belief M1 provides only weak evidence for a memory belief M2 based on it, it shouldn’t follow that in the absence of defeaters you are justified in retaining M2. If I “remember” that rochester is sunny based on my memory that it was sunny on the day I drove through town, then in the absence of counterevidence I’m not justified in retaining the belief that rochester is sunny. rather, we want a conservative principle that applies only to beliefs so to speak delivered to our current self by our past self. We do better to restrict (EC) to memory beliefs that are not based on other memory beliefs or indeed on any other beliefs at all. let us call these ‘basic memory beliefs’. In other words, we replace (EC) with: (Memorial EC) If one has a basic memory belief that p, then one is prima facie justified in retaining that belief that p. 80 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s I do not claim that Memorial EC could be a fundamental epistemic principle. I agree that if it is true, it ought to be true in virtue of some deeper principle. however, even without having in hand a plausible deeper grounding, if Memorial EC respects and makes sense of our intuitions about particular cases, this is prima facie reason to think it is true. Indeed, I think Memorial EC does quite well making sense of intuitions concerning the good and bad memory cases. In these cases, it seemed that the subject was justified in retaining her memory belief (even if the subject in the bad cases lacked a historically justified belief). Memorial EC gets this right. Memorial EC is also plausible on its face. When it comes to belief formation, it seems we need evidence or some sort of ground to make us justified in forming the belief; however, in the case of belief retention, at least when our beliefs that are basic memories, we need positive reason to abandon those beliefs. That is to say, plausibly, there is a kind of “innocent‐until‐proven‐guilty” principle that holds for basic memory beliefs. still, Memorial EC may look like a very bold principle. I will argue, however, that both reliabilists and evidentialists are committed to it. If I’m right about this, then, bold as Memorial EC is, it is not bolder than either reliabilism or evidentialism. Consider reliabilism first. recall terminal‐phase reliabilism. On this view, so long as a belief‐dependent process – a doxastic transition process – is conditionally reliable, one is prima facie justified in making that transition. Pure memorial retention is clearly condi- tionally reliable. Thus, one is always prima facie justified in retaining beliefs, indeed, whether they are basic memory beliefs or not. Thus, reliabilism implies Memorial EC, and indeed it implies EC. In the case of evidentialism, all we need to do is to add the plausible assumption that when one has a basic memory belief that p one either has or is disposed to recollect that p. As we’ve seen, Goldman’s two‐pronged challenge to the evidentialist seems to force her to claim that dispositions to recollect are evidence, indeed strong enough evidence to account for the justification of the relevant memory beliefs. so, modulo the plausible assumption that basic memory beliefs come with dispositions to recollect, evidentialists are committed to Memorial EC. I close by briefly discussing objections to epistemic conservatism and assessing their impact on Memorial EC. I will discuss three (see McGrath (2007) for more extensive discussion of these objections). The first is what might be called the “conversion” objection (Foley 1983; huemer 1999; Christensen 2000). If I originally believe something for a bad reason, then forget the bad reason and keep the belief as a basic memory belief, do I become justified? That seems highly implausible. The answer should be clear from earlier parts of the chapter: there is no conversion; rather, the belief starts out and remains historically unjustified; however, at the later times one is justified to retain it. A second objection sometimes raised against epistemic conservatism is that it is a form of epistemic egoism, that it commits one to thinking that for each person s, s’s beliefs count more toward s’s justification than others’ beliefs do when s knows others’ beliefs (cf. Christensen 2000). Against Memorial EC, the objection would be that one’s own basic memory beliefs are epistemically privileged in this way. however, Memorial EC makes no claims about others’ beliefs. It is consistent with Memorial EC to think that each of us is justified in treating a belief preserved either from our earlier self or from another believer T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 81 as worthy of trust.xiii The form this sort of trust takes with respect to beliefs preserved from one’s past self is to retain the belief. The form it takes with respect to beliefs of others is to use the fact that the other person believes it as one’s evidential basis for believ- ing it. These remarks here are just a sketch of how one might incorporate Memorial EC within a framework that is fully epistemically egalitarian.xiv The third is the “extra epistemic boost” objection (Foley 1983; huemer 1999). The objection is that if epistemic conservatism is true then whenever we believe a proposition p and retain our original evidence, we get an extra boost in justification with respect to p beyond anything that original evidence provides, and this is deemed problematic. suppose you start out with evidence E, which provides you a reason of strength k to believe p. Then you believe p on the basis of E. Do you then have a justification of strength greater than k to believe p? Presumably not. Of course, Memorial EC does not claim that whenever we believe a proposition we get any such extra epistemic boost. It accrues to one only when one’s belief is a basic memory belief – a memory belief that is not based on other beliefs. so if I have evidence E, which gives me a reason of strength k to believe p, then if I believe p on the basis of E, the ante- cedent of Memorial EC isn’t true, and so there is no problematic extra boost. What if I retain my original evidence for p but nevertheless my belief that p is still a basic memory belief? This seems possible. One might remember one’s original evidence but not believe p at the later time because of that evidence. At the later time, one might simply retain the belief not based on any evidence, or at least any other belief. Wouldn’t Memorial EC imply a problematic extra boost in this sort of case? I don’t see a problem here. having a justification to retain a belief that p from source X while also having a jus- tification to believe p from source y does not of course imply that one has a degree of justification that is the sum of the degrees one would have with X or y alone, nor does it even imply that one’s justification is greater than it would be with X or y alone. If I retain my original evidence, this needn’t make me significantly more justified or even more justi- fied at all. however, knowing one’s original good evidence can add to the resilience of one’s justification. It will be less liable to defeat. If I don’t know my original good evidence then I am more susceptible to being reasonably taken in by misleading evidence that my original evidence wasn’t strong. similarly, knowing one’s original poor evidence – sup- posing one doesn’t know its weakness – can reduce the resilience of one’s justification. I will not propose an account of how the justification to retain a belief ensured by Memorial EC and the justifications provided by the original evidence combine to deter- mine one’s resultant justification to retain the belief. In seeking such an account, I would suggest that we bear in mind similar issues concerning testimonial justification. Consider the question: if someone tells me that p and I know their evidence E on the basis of which they believe p, how does the justification provided by E stack up with that provided by the fact that the person testified to me that p? I suggest as a working assumption that we give analogous answers to these questions in the memory and the testimony cases. This is not the place to mount a full‐scale defense of the conservative principle Memorial EC or to explore possible groundings for it either in evidentialist, reliabilist or other epistemological frameworks.xv here I merely recommend it as a neutral baseline from which epistemologists of different persuasions might work. 82 Th E Jus TIFICA TIO n OF M EMO r y B E l IEF s 6 Conclusion Goldman raised a powerful two‐pronged challenge to the evidentialist: to solve the problem of forgotten evidence in a way that doesn’t make it impossible to solve the problem of stored beliefs. To answer the challenge, we concluded that the evidentialist must claim that our dispositions to recollect are evidence we have for our memory beliefs, and indeed, given a basing requirement, this must somehow be evidence we base our beliefs on. Given these difficulties for evidentialism, we might think reliabilism is clearly the way to go. however, we have seen that reliabilism, too, has troubles explaining memory justification. This becomes particularly clear when we distinguish two justificatory sta- tuses applicable to memory beliefs: the justification to retain a belief vs. the historical justification of that belief (its being justifiedly formed and maintained throughout its his- tory). The reliabilist account of the justification to retain a belief explains this justification in terms of conditional reliability. however, the same sorts of familiar objections to relia- bilism about justified formations of beliefs arise for conditional reliability accounts of justified retention. Given the problems for both evidentialism and reliabilism, I suggest we scale back our ambitions and seek a principle to deliver the right results on cases, even if it does not tell us what fundamentally makes memory beliefs justified. A certain form of epistemic conservatism, I argue, holds great promise in this respect. The particular con- servative principle I recommend ought to be acceptable to reliabilists and evidentialists alike, and it fares well against standard objections to epistemic conservatism. Notes i It would be more accurate to call this view “current state” internalist evidentialism. ii Claiming that whether a particular doxastic state fits a subject’s evidence is fixed by that sub- ject’s mental states does not commit one to claiming that evidential fittingness is itself a mental state. One might think that a subject’s mental states fix whether a doxastic attitude fits her evidence only insofar as some subset of her mental states are her having the body of evidence she has and it is a necessary truth that for any subject with that body of evidence such and such doxastic attitude fits that body of evidence. iii There are versions of evidentialism that are not mentalistic. Goldman (2011) develops a syn- thesis between reliabilism and evidentialism. The view abandons the thesis of mentalism. iv Even in this classic article, Goldman anticipated many objections to reliabilism and consid- ered modifications of what I am calling “original process reliabilism.” so, my use of “original” shouldn’t be taken to suggest that Goldman hadn’t already considered revisions to this view. v This is not his only attack. Another powerful challenge he poses is to explain precisely when and why perceptual beliefs are immediately justified. see Goldman (2008). vi Tulving gives other features he claims are distinctive of (the exercise of) episodic memory, including a consciousness of self. In comparative psychology, sometimes an alternative def- inition is used from Clayton and Dickinson (1998): episodic memory is a capacity to enjoy what‐where‐when memory representations that can be used by the creature in planning and decision‐making. vii There is evidence from amnesia studies (both anterograde and retrograde) for a double dissoci- ation between episodic and semantic memory, i.e., there are cases in which semantic memory is T h E J us TIFICA TIO n OF MEMO r y BE l IEF s 83 largely spared but episodic memory impaired and vice versa. For a textbook summary of these findings, see Baddeley et al. (2009: ch. 6). There is also evidence that different brain areas are activated during learning and retrieval (cf. Wheeler et al. (1997)). viii not all retentions of beliefs, however, are memorial. If you acquire new evidence and reaffirm or base your belief on this evidence, this is a way of retaining your belief but it isn’t memorial. Memorial retention does not involve any sort of rebasing or reaffirming. ix see Goldman 1979, 1999, 2009, 2011. x similar concerns about basing apply to the view that our memory beliefs are justified by evidence of the sorts mentioned in the previous paragraph. Is it plausible that we base our memory beliefs on such evidence? If not how does this evidence make a difference to ex post justification of memory beliefs? (For more on the ex ante/ex post distinction, see Goldman’s (1979: 21) classic discussion.) xi under the heading of conscious evidence, Conee and Feldman consider the “conscious qual- ities of the recollection including its vivaciousness and [its] associated feeling of confidence” (2001: 9). see Pollock (1986) for an extended defense of a recollection‐based epistemology of memory. xii In standard instances of prohibition dilemmas, the subject has decisive reasons/evidence/ grounds against taking each of her available actions. But in the Mary/st Andrews case, one doesn’t have such reasons, etc. that make each of the options prohibited. For a discussion of prohibition dilemmas, see McConnell (2014: section 7). xiii Cf. Jones (2002) on the relation between self‐trust and testimony. xiv An evidentialist who claims our justification to retain memory beliefs comes from the non- doxastic states of recollection ought to tie such justification closely to the justification to trust past beliefs, at least one’s own past, beliefs. The evidentialist, like the rest of us, knows that these states of recollection, if reliable, stem from previous beliefs, in most cases retained up to the present but in some not. After all, states of recollection that p not stemming from one’s past belief that p (or one’s past belief in some appropriately related proposition) are generally unreliable. Moreover, the evidentialist knows that all beliefs, at least if given the same elabora- tive and maintenance rehearsal (which need not involve accumulation of substantial evidential support), equally give rise at later times to dispositions to recollect. so, the evidentialist can appreciate that by believing that p based on a recollection that p, she is using a method that is reliable only if one’s own past beliefs are reliable. Thus, the evidentialist must grant that the suitably reflective subject is justified in retaining a belief based on a recollection only if she is justified in thinking her own past beliefs are generally reliable and so justified in trusting those beliefs. xv see McGrath (2007) for some earlier efforts in this vein.

Matthew McGrath makes a searching exploration of the process reliabilist approach to memory‐based justification. his treatment of my debate with “current state internalist evidentialism” – the Feldman and Conee view – is acute in every detail. so I was pleased to find him drawing the following conclusion at the end of section I: “This [process relia- bilist account] is a simple and attractive account, starkly contrasting with the daunting challenge facing the evidentialist.” however, jubilation at that juncture would have been a premature and intemperate reaction. McGrath is a philosopher who leaves no stone unturned; and we shall have to pay close attention to one of the stones he turns. McGrath focuses his attention on what he calls “bad memory cases,” which he claims pose problems for reliabilism. These are cases in which a belief is originally formed on the basis of a poor source of evidence. later the evidential source is forgotten; but the agent retains the original belief simply as something she remembers. suppose, for example, that you have excellent reason for distrusting a certain friend of yours vis‐à‐vis matters of scottish history. nonetheless, upon hearing this person assert that Mary Queen of scots was held under house arrest in st Andrews for a period, you come to believe that proposi- tion. later you forget the weakness of your evidential source and later yet, no better source for the same proposition emerges. you continue to retain this belief, however, for a considerable time. What should we say about the justificational status of your belief in such a “bad memory” case? McGrath contends that you are justified in retaining the belief via memory. Indeed, you are exactly as well justified in retaining it in this “bad case” as you would be in a hypo- thetical “good case,” in which your evidential source is entirely trustworthy. he expands on this line of thinking as follows. Reply to McGrath 86 rEP l y T O M C Gr A T h In both good and bad cases, he holds, it is reasonable of you to retain the Mary Queen of scots belief. Moreover this reasonable retention is itself a justificatory status. One is every bit as justified in retaining the belief whether one is in the good or the bad memory case. But if this is right, how can an epistemologist maintain each of the following two claims: (1) that the subject is equally justified in retaining his belief in both good and bad cases, and (2) that the good‐case belief has a better justificatory status than the bad‐case belief? But reliabilism seems to commit us to holding both (1) and (2). Therefore, McGrath concludes, reliabilism is in trouble. how, exactly, does a problem arise? here is how I reconstruct McGrath’s thinking. According to the historical conception of process reliabilism, a belief that obtains at time t is justified if and only if it is the product of a history of successive belief‐forming and/ or belief‐retaining cognitive processes each of which is either unconditionally reliable (if it is a belief‐independent process) or conditionally reliable (if it is a belief‐dependent process). This requirement is ostensibly satisfied in the “good case,” in which the original source’s testimony is entirely credible. But it is unsatisfied in the “bad case,” in which the original source is not credible. Thus, the verdict required of claim (2) is ratified: the good‐ case belief has a better justificatory status than the bad‐case belief. so far, so good. What about claim (1)? Is reliabilism committed to ratifying that claim as well, as McGrath seems to suggest? Claim (1) speaks of being equally justified “in retaining” the belief in both cases. The posing of this question points to a very important strand of McGrath’s line of argument. McGrath assumes that there are such things as “justified (or unjustified) retentions,” or what he refers to as justified or unjustified “transitions.” As against this, I submit that reliabilism as standardly presented uses no such phraseology and has no such theoretical commitment. The things that are justified or unjustified are beliefs, or belief states, not processes, operations, or transitions. McGrath argues that I “recog- nize” such things. he says: “Thus Goldman recognizes justified transitions as well as historically justified beliefs.” he doesn’t quote me to this effect (there is no such passage to quote), but he explains: “To have a justified doxastic transition is to have a belief produced by a process the final phase of which is a conditionally reliable belief dependent process.” he also asks, “how can Goldman explain the status of being justified in retaining a belief?” One way to “explain” this is by disavowing the idea that retentions as such have justificational status. A retention is a kind of cognitive process or operation, in particular, a belief‐dependent one. under reliabilism, such processes or operations are assumed to be good or bad insofar as they are either conditionally reliable or unreliable. In themselves, though, they have no justificatory status. Depending on the justificational status of their inputs, they can generate justified doxastic outputs (beliefs). But this is only if all of their doxastic inputs are themselves justified. no cognitive process, operation, or transition (type) in and of itself should be deemed to have justificatory status. so process reliabilism has no need for the notion of “justified retentions” or “justified transitions.” however, couldn’t reliabilism live with a notion of a (belief‐dependent) process token which has justificatory status? This could work if one builds into this notion not rEP l y T O MCG r A T h 87 only the requirement that the process token be an instance of a conditionally reliable type but also that all of its doxastic inputs are justified. In this case, however, the (token) retention processes in the good and bad cases, respectively, will not share the same justificatory statuses. A good‐case retention process (token) will be justified whereas a bad‐case retention process (token) will not. hence, reliabilism is not committed to holding both (1) and (2) to be true. On the contrary, claim (2) is true but claim (1) is not. Quandary dissolved. Goldman and His Critics, First Edition. Edited by Brian P. McLaughlin and Hilary Kornblith. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Unreliable Testimony Eliz ab ET h Fri ck E r 5 Reliabilism is the dominant theory in contemporary analytic epistemology. This would not be so without the work of Alvin Goldman. Pioneering articles, now classics, argued vigorously and persuasively for his versions of reliabilism about knowledge, and about epistemic justification (Goldman 1976, 1979). They were followed by a major book developing his new process‐reliabilist epistemology (Goldman 1986). More recently Goldman has extended his reliabilist theory, now in the modified guise of veritism, to the developing field of social epistemology including testimony of which he is  –  once again  –  a pioneering champion (Goldman 1999). If there were a philosophy Olympics Alvin Goldman would be a multi‐gold medallist i. Since the classic (Goldman 1976) several authors have proposed broadly reliabilist accounts of knowledge that differ on details (Dretske 1981; Nozick 1981; Zagzebski 1996; Greco 2000; Sosa 2007). The core idea is that knowledge is belief that is non‐accidentally or reliably true. Goldman (1976) proposed that perceptual belief is knowledge just if the  believer would not form a similar but false belief in various “relevant alternative” situations, thus proposing reliability conceived modally as necessary for knowledgeii. Nozick (1981) recognized that, to avoid intuitively incorrect results, this modal reliability condition must be relativized to the method or process by which the belief subject to this condition is formed. Debate has focused on the tricky and crucial “generality problem” of how these methods or processes should be individuated; and on how to select the domain of “relevant alternative” situations with respect to which the reliability of a belief, or belief‐producing process, is evaluated. Some have maintained that these problems admit of no convincing general solution, so that reliabilism offers no informative reduc­ tion, nor even a genuinely constraining conceptually independent necessary condition for knowledge (Williamson 2000). The leading positive objection to reliabilism is that it fails u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 89 to accommodate “internalist” intuitions requiring an epistemic rationality or doxastic‐ responsibility condition on knowledge. The internalist invokes, providing examples, the possibility of a belief‐producing process possessed by an agent which is in fact perfectly reliable, while this fact remains wholly unrepresented within the agent’s own epistemic perspective. The indicated conclusion is that reliability in the process by which a belief is formed is not sufficient for that belief ’s epistemic rationality, nor therefore for its being justified or constituting knowledge (bonJour 1980, 1985). In contrast with this controversy over whether reliability  –  aptly explicated  –  is sufficient for knowledge, it is now widely accepted that reliability is a necessary condition for knowledge, even if not an independently well‐determined one. This thesis is now hardly more controversial than the tenet that knowledge that p requires belief that p. but consideration of testimony as a source of knowledge gives cause for some further thought on this matter. So shall I argue in the present contribution. In (Fricker 1987) I argued that the case of testimony reveals the insufficiency of reliabilism as an account of knowledge, because it cannot account for the datum that language‐use is a single skill: the cognitive package that is needed and suffices for the acquisition of knowledge through testimony is also sufficient for giving testimony. This is so, I argued, because the roles of testifier and recipient respectively both require mastery of the basics of folk linguistics – a conception of the nature of the speech act of telling, and its consequent epistemic force as a source of knowledge. In the present chapter, in contrast, I raise and review some consid­ erations which throw doubt on the widely accepted thesis (call it R‐NEC) that reliability is necessary for knowledge. What follows has four main parts. In section  1 I formulate our problem of interest precisely. In section 2 I consider whether the generally pessimistic results in the experi­ mental literature from social psychology concerning subjects’ ability in a test situation to tell, from behavioral cues, whether a speaker is lying, present a severe challenge for R‐NeC. My conclusion is that these results, interesting though they are, should not precipitate epistemologists into a panic retreat from R‐NeC on the basis that it is incon­ sistent with what we know about situated human capacities. The experimental studies do not provide any strong evidence against the positive empirical claim that testimony recipi­ ents typically utilize background social knowledge to screen effectively for competence and honesty in the testifiers they actually encounter in everyday situations. In section 3 I argue further that even if the positive empirical claim were shown false, this need not indicate rejecting R‐NeC, as opposed to maintaining that givers and receivers of testimony jointly need to do better. In section 4 I develop a more classic line of thought invoking intuitions about cases which suggests that there is, however, cause from another source to put in question R‐NeC, at least in the case of testimonial knowledge. My conclusion is not that the core reliabilist intuition is faulty and should be abandoned, but that it needs to be accommodated in an alternative version of reliabilism. I introduce and defend this variant theory, Approved‐List Reliabilism. The proposal is similar to one made in Goldman (1992) in relation to epistemic justification; here I propose it as systemizing ordinary lan­ guage intuitions about knowledge. In my final section 5 I draw out some threads from what has emerged so far, to show how testimony reveals the need for a new kind of analysis, illustrating the need and scope for social epistemology. 90 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 1 Testimony and Reliability R‐NEC is the thesis that reliability (aptly explicated) of a subject’s belief is necessary for that belief to be knowledge. R‐NeC is grounded in a strong anti‐luck intuition: if a belief amounts to knowledge, it cannot be just a matter of luck, or chance, that that belief turned out true. Goldman (1976) takes up the anti‐luck intuition about knowledge and explicates it modally, in his account of perceptual knowledge: a perceptually based belief amounts to knowledge just if there is no relevant alternative possible situation in which the subject would have formed an equivalent percept and similar belief which was false. I think this modal conception of reliability best explicates our anti‐luck intuition about knowledge iii. A plausible modal reliability condition on knowledge must apply the modal reliability requirement to the method or process by which the belief in question is formed iv. So we can explicate reliability, as featuring in R‐NeC, in the following definition: Reliability (first formulation): A person who forms v a certain belief b by means of a method M she possesses, satisfies Reliability with respect to b just if: b is true, and there are no rele­ vant alternative possible situations in which S forms a relevantly similar false belief by using M. Which alternative possible situations are the relevant ones, as invoked in Reliability? The objection previously mentioned might be invoked: that we have no grip on what these are, in some example, independent of our grip on whether the belief at issue amounts to knowledge or not. but we can explicate the notion of “relevant alternative” thus: the rel­ evant alternatives are those that might easily have obtained. Here, I suggest, we have an ordinary language notion that there is some independent purchase on. (you arrive in your seat at the Royal Opera House just as the doors are closing and the house‐lights going down, having allowed only forty minutes for your journey across town. “you should have left earlier, you might easily have missed the whole first act,” your companion reprimands you. Some everyday uses of “might” signal epistemic possibility; but there is, I suggest, an established ordinary language usage which, as in this example, reflects the idea that there are alternative possible ways things might have gone, differing only in relatively trivial, non‐fundamental respects – ones which might easily have come about – in which things differ in the respect at issue.) So, I propose to regiment our chosen notions thus: the relevant alternative situations are just those that might easily have obtained vi. Given this regimentation, Reliability can alternatively be formulated in the following equivalent condition vii: Reliability (second formulation): A person who forms a certain belief b by means of a method M she possesses, satisfies Reliability with respect to b just if b is true, and it is not the case that she might easily have formed a relevantly similar belief b’ by means of M which was false. In the present discussion I follow Goldman (1979, 1986) viii and take the belief‐forming methods or processes featuring in Reliability to be internal to the believing subject – individuated “narrowly,” not “broadly.” u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 91 (Some further comments on details for the precise‐minded. First, reliability may be explicated modally, in terms of relevant alternative possible situations, ones that might easily have obtained, as is done here; or it may be explained in actual‐world track‐record statistical terms – as has been done when explicating reliability that makes for epistemic justification rather than knowledgeix. These will yield different results in various possible circumstances: a frequently employed process with a good actual‐world track record to date could be modally unreliable in a given situation, or vice versa. I believe the modal conception best explicates our anti‐luck intuition concerning knowledge, which is grounded in intuitions about what might easily have occurred, and what could not easily have been different. The modal conception has the advantage that it applies to a process that is in fact employed only once – for instance a single acceptance of testimony. Second, we need to speak of a relevantly similar belief, rather than the very same belief, for several reasons. It is not clear whether that very token belief could have had a different cause; nor is it adequate to say: a belief with the very same content. Where the proposition believed is a necessary truth it could not be false, so Reliability, if applied only to belief in the very same proposition, is trivially satisfied x. As to what constitutes relevant simi­ larity of belief, there are murky and crucial issues here that I will skirt around. If we require “global” reliability of the method then we can simply say: not easily would she form a false belief using that same method M. but this is too strong. Consider that I may do an exercise of addition on small numbers and intuitively, my belief is reliably formed. but I may be unreliable in adding together long sequences of very large numbers. So a “relevantly similar” belief needs to be something finer‐grained than just: any belief arrived at by using the same method, if we individuate methods coarse‐grainedly, for instance “addition.”) What is the epistemological upshot when we apply R‐NeC, explicated modally in terms of Reliability, to the case of testimony? In applying Reliability to testimony I assume first, that the method M is the broad one: formation of belief through accept­ ance of encountered testimony. (Call a person’s beliefs formed through acceptance of testimony her T‐beliefs.) I assume that the recipient has a single psychologically real cognitive process of testimony‐reception, her (narrow) T‐method. Her T‐method on any occasion will result either in acceptance of and formation of belief in what she is told, or in non‐acceptance xi. And I assume that other “relevantly similar” beliefs are any other beliefs formed through acceptance of someone’s testimonyxii. This being so, a subject will satisfy Reliability with respect to some belief that she forms on an occasion O, through acceptance of testimony, just if it is not the case that her testimonial environment on O is such that she might easily have encountered testimony (from either the same or another speaker) which is both false, and whose untrustworthiness she would have failed to detect and hence she would have accepted it. We need to introduce this notion of a testimonial environment (T‐ environment) to explicate Reliability in relation to testimony; it is linked with that of what instances of testimony the recipient might easily encounter – these last are just the instances of testimony that the T‐environment might yield. With these points on the interpretation of Reliability in regard to testimony settled, we can now investigate the question of what R‐NeC requires of a recipient of testimony. This is what we find: 92 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y (1) Testimony is Falsity‐Prone (TFP): Testimony as a source of belief is liable to instances of false testimony that are relevant alternatives: it is in the nature of testimony, and is typically the case, that a recipient of testimony in her normal T‐environmentxiii might easily encounter instances of false testimony.xiv TFP holds as a law‐like general truth about the human social institution of testimony. It is so because human testimony, by its nature, is not an entirely reliable source of belief. False statements made through deceptive intent, or honest error, are an intrinsic and perennial possibility. This being so it is typically the case that a recipient of testimony in her normal testimonial environment might easily encounter instances of false testimony. This being so it follows that: (2) Reliability for Testimony Requires an Effective Filter: A person A who on some occasion O forms a certain belief b through accepting another’s testimony satisfies Reliability regarding b if and only if she, in her T‐environment on O, satisfies eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR, where this is the following condition: EFFECTIVE FILTER: A’s T‐method includes a filter that would detect and block belief in all the instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter; so that she is disposed to believe only the true, knowledge‐expressing xv instances among the testimonies she might easily encounterxvi. eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR imposes a substantial condition on a person in her T‐environment only if there are indeed some instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter in that T‐environment, as TFP insists typically to be so. eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR is trivi­ ally fulfilled by a person in her T‐environment if the latter is such that there are no instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter. (How the T‐environment of a recipient affects how much she herself must contribute in order to secure modal reliabil­ ity of her T‐beliefs is a theme developed in what follows.) (2) assumes that when someone responds to an instance of testimony her response instances a general testimony‐processing method, her T‐method, which she deploys for all received testimony, and that this is a psychologically real cognitive process internal to herxvii. These presuppositions are in line with Goldman’s framework. (In section  4 we briefly consider relaxing the assumption that the processes relevant for evaluation of reliability are always best individuated narrowly.) (2) is deliberately stated in broad terms. It insists that the recipient of testimony in her T‐environment must somehow possess an effective filter to screen out relevant instances of false testimony, but is noncommittal as to how precisely this is instantiated. eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR is consistent with either a personal‐level process that proceeds via the subject’s forming reliably true beliefs about the testifier’s trustworthiness; or with a purely sub‐ personal filter, one that may operate without the recipient’s attention or any focused awareness of it. It does insist that this process is effective – that is to say, it succeeds in detecting and blocking belief in all instances of easily encountered false testimony. Only so is Reliability ensured. (2) specifies what is needed for a testimony recipient in her T‐environment to satisfy Reliability in relation to her reception of testimony. So (2) and R‐NeC together imply: u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 93 (3) EF‐NEC: to obtain knowledge from instances of testimony, a recipient in her T‐environment must satisfy eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR; that is, her T‐method must include a filter that would detect and block belief in all instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter; so that she is disposed to believe only the true, knowledge‐expressing instances amongst the testimo­ nies she might easily encounter. Is TFP compelling? It is – though there are important complications and qualifications, as will be revealed in our subsequent discussion. Testimony is effected by speech acts of telling xviii. As folk linguistics and folk psychology reveal, while such speech acts of telling should, as a matter of social norm, be expressions of the testifier’s knowledge (Williamson 2000; Fricker 2006, 2015), they may fail to be so and state a falsehood if she either is careless and states something she does not know through honest error; or if she sets out intentionally to deceive, and lies to her intended audience. So it is in the nature of testimony that false testimony is entirely possible, and is a real risk confronting any recipient of testimony. It is a law‐like general empirical truth that testimony is not in practice a completely reliable source of belief, if accepted uncritically. This is consistent with great variation in the frequency and manner of false testimony liable to be encountered on different topics, and in different social and cultural settings. This theme will be developed below. R‐NeC and our empirical datum TFP together imply that familiar “anti‐reductionist” or “fundamentalist” accounts of what it takes to acquire knowledge through testimony are untenable xix. They fail to ensure R‐NeC is satisfied, since – as we are about to see – they do not impose any condition that ensures that eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR is satisfied. A familiar fundamentalist epistemic principle concerning knowledge from testimony is: K‐SUFF: If S testifies that p to H, and in doing so expresses her knowledge that P, and H forms belief in p through accepting S’s testimony, and H possesses no doxastic defeatersxx for S’s testimony that p, then H thereby comes to know that p.xxi A recipient of testimony Rita might form true belief through accepting knowledgeable testimony for which she has no doxastic defeaters on an occasion, while her T‐method does not include an effective filter  –  she would believe false testimony that she might easily have encountered instead xxii. The antecedent of K‐SuFF is fulfilled on this occasion, but Rita does not fulfill the modal reliability condition imposed by eF‐NeC. If K‐SuFF were a correct epistemic principle, Rita would gain knowledge; but R‐NeC denies that she gets knowledge, since her belief‐forming method is not modally reliable. If modal reliability is indeed needed for knowledge, K‐SuFF is too liberal in its apportion­ ing of testimonially based knowledge, and is not a correct epistemic principle xxiii. The concern of this discussion is with the plausibility of a modal reliability condition on knowledge derived from testimony. We have noted that an account of what it is for a belief to be epistemically justified in terms of its being produced by a reliable process, as pioneered in Goldman (1979), perforce explicates reliability differently, using some pre­ cise version of the idea: a belief is justified just if it is produced by a process that generates true, as opposed to false, beliefs, a sufficiently high proportion of the time (call this a suitably veritistic process). Now a belief can be produced by a suitably veritistic process and yet be false; even when true, it is not guaranteed in virtue of its suitably veritistic 94 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y genesis to satisfy our modal requirement Reliability. Nor is Reliability a strictly stronger requirement than suitably veritistic genesis. Nonetheless, it seems likely that suitably veritistic genesis will tend to make for modal reliability, and vice versa – our two conditions, though neither entails the other, may be expected to have a high positive cor­ relation. If this were not so, there would be a theoretically unfortunate divorce between conditions making for justification, and those that are required for knowledge: we would have an alarming amassing of cases of justified true belief that, on our twin accounts of epistemic justification and of a necessary reliability condition for knowledge, do not con­ stitute knowledge although they are not Gettier cases. In the case of testimony I suggest that a T‐method that in the subject’s T‐environment constitutes an effective filter, thereby ensuring eF‐NeC is satisfied, and the subject is equipped to gain knowledge from acceptance of testimony on favorable occasions, is also going to be one that is suitably veritistic, rendering the testimonial beliefs she forms by means of it epistemically justifiedxxiv. That is to say: a T‐method that consti­ tutes an effective filter for a testimony recipient in her T‐environment will be a norma­ tively apt testimony reception process, one which generates epistemically justified testimony beliefs. On the other side – to repeat the point made above – it would be unfortunate if our account of conditions for acceptance of encountered testimony to yield justified beliefs came significantly apart from our account of what is required for testimonial knowledge, so that a subject might often acquire justified true testimonial beliefs that were not knowl­ edge, while not being generated through acceptance of a false lemma. This desideratum entails that a fundamentalist account of conditions for acceptance of testimony to yield justified belief are too weak, as follows: A fundamentalist principle about testimonial justificationxxv runs along these lines: DEFAULT‐JUSTIFIED (DEFJUS): If H receives testimony that p, and forms belief that p in acceptance of it, and H has no doxastic defeatersxxvi for the testimony, then she is prima facie justified in believing that p. It is obvious that DeFJuS fails to impose any condition on the recipient of testimony H which ensures the modal reliability condition required for knowledge by R‐NeC is ful­ filled. DeFJuS specifies the absence of doxastic defeaters in a case as a condition needed and sufficing for justified belief in that case; but does not impose on H the general require­ ment that she would be sensitive to defeaters, if they were present. What precisely would constitute “defeaters” of an instance of testimony remains vague; however it is not so vague that we cannot securely conclude that, even if such a defeaters‐sensitivity condition were included, it would fall far short of the EFFECTIVE FILTER requirement needed to ensure modal reliability of a recipient in her environment, for many testimonial envi­ ronments. Consider that a practiced liar may not betray any signs of her mendacity. This point is further confirmed in our discussion at the end of section 2, which underlines how doxastic responsibility does not ensure modal reliability. If it were the case that DeFJuS gives the correct account of what is required for justified testimonial belief, then we would have multiple cases of justified true belief that do not qualify as knowledge but are not u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 95 Gettier cases  –  cases where the recipient accepts knowledgeable testimony properly in accordance with DeFJuS, but does not satisfy eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR,xxvii and which do not involve her belief in a false lemma. From what we have seen so far it follows that a normative account of what it takes to acquire knowledge through acceptance of testimony which respects the anti‐luck intui­ tion of R‐NeC will be a “reductionist” epistemology, in that it will impose a require­ ment that a recipient’s T‐method somehow instantiate an effective filter.xxviii Note that for R‐NeC to be satisfied, the possession of a filter effective in her T‐environment is required if a recipient is on any occasion at all in that T‐environment to obtain knowl­ edge from testimony. To summarize what we have established: testimony qua epistemic source is liable to relevant‐alternative instances of false testimony (TFP). This being so, a recipient of testimony’s T‐method satisfies Reliability, thereby conforming to R‐NeC, if and only if she satisfies eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR; that is to say, her T‐method includes a filter that, in her T‐environment, would detect and block belief in all instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter so that she is disposed to believe only the true, knowledge‐expressing instances amongst the testimonies she might easily encounter. To put it bluntly: if modal reliability is a necessary condition for knowledge then, if you occasionally do or might easily lie to me, then even when you tell me what you know, I can gain knowledge from what you knowingly tell me, only if I would be able to detect your mendacity, were you to lie to me. It seems pretty much non‐negotiable to accept that testimony is a source of knowledge – that is, that people, members of human societies, are able sometimes to get knowledge at second‐hand by means of testimony. This being so, we may formulate: Strong Non‐Skeptical Constraint (Strong‐NSC): Most of the beliefs that normal people form through their regular everyday acceptance of knowledgeable testimony are in turn knowledge. Strong‐NSC is vague; but not so vague that it fails to impose a very substantial condition that a proposed epistemology of testimony must satisfy, to conform with it. Strong‐NSC and eF‐NeC together imply: EMPIRICAL CLAIM (EC): Human recipients of testimony in normal society generally employ a T‐method including an effective filter by means of which they would detect and block belief in relevant‐alternative false testimonies – ones they might easily encounter. eC is a substantial empirical proposition; it may or may not be true. If it were estab­ lished to be false then, given Strong‐NSC, modus tollens could be applied to show that, after all, eF‐NeC and its source R‐NeC do not hold of testimony. That is, consideration of testimony would show that modal reliability cannot after all be a global necessary condition for knowledge. In the next section I address the worry that recent research in social psychology does indeed show eC to be false, thus forcing us to either embrace skepticism about testimony as a significant source of justified belief apt to be knowledge, or to abandon R‐NeC. 96 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 2 An Empirical Case Against R‐NEC? The Relativity of Reliability How ordinary people usually form belief in response to testimony – how critical they seek to be, or are constituted and habituated to be; and whether they succeed in effective mon­ itoring to detect the false testimony they actually encounter or easily might encounter in the social environments they typically find themselves in – is an empirical question. Thus, whether current human testimony‐reception practices and habits conform to proposed necessary conditions for knowledge developed from the armchair by philosophers is not a question I shall answer definitely in this discussion. Joseph Shieber is a philosopher who has attended closely to empirical studies of testimony‐reception; and he has drawn negative conclusions about the conformity of ordinary people with the normative requirements suggested by philosophers (Shieber 2011). In this section I will suggest that his pessimism is not warranted by the evidence from social psychology that he cites. The empirical studies he cites do not establish that ordinary people do not and are unable to monitor effectively for truthfulness of the testimony they encounter in their social transactions in their everyday environments: they do not show that our empirical claim eC is false. TFP records the indisputable fact, certified as true by our folk understanding of the nature of the speech act of telling and the human failings it is subject to, that testimony qua epistemic source is liable to false instances  –  either through deceptive intent, or through honest error. but the global truth of TFP is consistent with great cultural variation in the frequency and nature of false testimony that recipients of testimony are at risk of encoun­ tering, in their normal social environment. In addition, within a given broad cultural‐social environment, there may be very specific local variations between contexts in the likelihood and character of possible false testimony that recipients run the risk of encountering. Reliability of a process in producing a given outcome is, as a matter of logic, relative to a range of possible inputs to it, and so to an environment supplying these inputs in which said process operates. What it takes to be an aptly discerning recipient of testimony – one who effectively detects and blocks belief in the instances of false testimony actually or easily encountered – varies, is more or less demanding, according to that recipient’s testimonial environment: what frequency and what manner of false testimony she might easily encounter. Suppose a research team receives funding for an investigation of the reliability of ordi­ nary people’s visual perceptual judgments. Suppose they set up an experiment to test this as follows: they construct an environment, through which the experimental subjects are conducted and are asked to report on what they can see around them. This environment contains a series of perceptual illusions and tricks – holograms, trompe l’oeil paintings, trick mirrors, and so forth. Suppose first the subjects have not been told of the tricky nature of their environment. Naturally, their perceptually based beliefs, reported from their tour, display a considerable degree of falsity  –  they were tricked by the trickery. but  even in the variant experiment where they are forewarned, this will not suffice to eliminate falsity in the beliefs they form; unless a subject adopts the desperate strategy of forming no beliefs from what she seems to see at all. The team writes up its research and concludes that visual perception is a highly error‐prone and unreliable source of belief. u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 97 This conclusion is not warranted by its findings. Or rather: its findings are correct if understood as concerning only the subjects’ performance in the environment in which the experiment placed them. It is deeply misleading, if interpreted as having significance for the general reliability of visual perception as a source of belief outside that specific tricky environment. Reliability of a process or faculty is, as a matter of logic, relative to an envi­ ronment in which it operates. So we must beware of exporting findings about reliability in a particular environment or situation beyond its specifics, to other situations that may be very different in relevant respects. Consider now the idea of a perceptually based recognitional capacity. A creature has a capacity to perceptually recognize some type of item iggs just if she can perceptually discriminate iggs from the relevant‐alternative non‐iggs – that is, all those items that are not iggs and that she might easily encounter. (Anything at all which is not an igg is a non‐ igg; but we are concerned with those non‐iggs which a subject might have some trouble in telling apart from iggs.) Discriminations in humans will issue, amongst other responses, in perceptually based judgments – “That’s an igg”/“That’s not an igg.” In other crea­ tures they may trigger forms of behavior apt when in the presence/absence of an igg. Now consider this scenario: I am a keen observer of the birds that come into my garden. There are various species, members of which show up regularly, others occasionally, yet others, never. In this situation, at home looking out of the window into my garden, I have a recognitional capacity for robins. I am disposed to form beliefs such as: that is a robin/ that is not a robin, on the basis of the visual appearance to me of any bird I spot in the garden, and these beliefs are formed by a modally reliable method, since I can indeed recognize a robin by its appearance. That is to say, I can discriminate robins by how they perceptually appear to me, in contrast with the relevant alternatives  –  the other bird‐ species members of which from time to time show up in my garden. Relative to the envi­ ronment of my garden, the inputs it provides, my perceptual method for forming beliefs about the presence or absence of robins is modally reliable. but then I go on holiday, to a distant place where various other bird‐species also show up regularly. These include bobbins  –  birds of a different species, with very different habits but which, while being slightly larger and heavier, have very similar coloring, shape and demeanor to robins. I fail to discriminate between robins and bobbins, mistaking bob­ bins for robins. even when I learn about the existence of bobbins, I cannot tell the two species apart on the basis of how they appear to me. In this new context I lose my homely recognitional capacity for robins. Any beliefs I form about their presence or absence on the basis of visual perception, even where true, will fail a modal reliability condition. When I stayed safely at home I could tell on the basis of perception whether or not a bird I saw was a robin. In my new holiday environ­ ment I lack this ability. In this changed environment my very same “narrow” perceptual processing method fails on the task – recognizing robins – it successfully fulfilled back home. I have not changed, but my environment has changed, introducing new relevant alternatives. The logic is exactly similar when we consider a recipient’s ability to tell when she is being lied to. ella, a teenager, has a circle of friends in which there is a strong norm of trust and honesty. They very rarely deceive each other – even to the point of preferring 98 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y honesty to tactfulness. In the situation of ella and her circle lying is infrequent, and anyone who lies is unpracticed, guilty and embarrassed. The liar shows tell‐tale signs and ella, no fool and perceptually well‐attuned, is able to detect them. Then ella’s father gets a new job, and the family moves to a city in another part of the country. ella goes to a new school with very different social conditions and mores. In her new school, lots of the pupils lie regularly in pursuit of their own selfish purposes and are practiced and profi­ cient dissemblers. ella retains the perceptual attunedness she previously possessed – her “narrow” T‐method is the same. but in her new environment the old skill is not sufficient for the different and more taxing task of detecting when these cynical streetwise city kids, her new classmates, are lying. The moral of our two tales is evident: possession of a discriminatory capacity for iggs enabling satisfaction of a modal reliability condition for judgments issuing from it is rela­ tive to an environment. The environment fixes the set of relevant alternative non‐iggs that the perceiver must be able to discriminate against. A perceiver who possesses a discrimi­ natory capacity in one environment will lack it in another environment, without any change in her “narrow” capacities, and due entirely to the difference in her environment. It is an instance of this broader phenomenon that whether a recipient possesses an effective filter to block instances of false testimony, ones that she might easily encounter, is only determinate relative to an environment. We saw this in the tale of ella, and the point generalizes. To summarize: eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR specifies that a testimony‐recipient’s T‐method includes a filter effective for the instances of false testimony that she, in her T‐environment, might easily encounter. but we have seen that whether this is satisfied is the upshot of the fit of the recipient’s “narrow” T‐method with her external social environment  –  her T­environment. eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR is trivially satisfied by a recipient when her T‐environment affords no instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter. More generally, how powerful a recipient’s internal filter needs to be – how finely attuned her capacity to detect falsity of an instance of testimony – turns on what the range of false testimony she might easily encounter is like. As we saw with ella: if a recipient finds herself in a community where lying is rare, and liars tend to be inept, revealing their mendacity by tell‐tale signs in their demeanor, then it is relatively easy for her to possess a T‐method with a filter effective in that T‐environment. If, in contrast, she finds herself in an environment of habitual and expert liars, the cognitive requirements for possession of a filter effective in that T‐environment are much more taxing, maybe impossible to fulfill. (Much more on this relation between filter and environment in my final section.) xxix The environment‐relativity of discriminatory capacities has immediate bearing on our present topic of whether the empirical findings cited by Shieber show that eC is false. The negative empirical findings, assuming their methodology is sound, xxx show that sub­ jects are unable to achieve any high percentage of success in their attempts to detect on the basis of their “demeanor” (that is, from cues in their verbal and non‐verbal behavior) the “liars,” that is falsity‐speakers, xxxi amongst a series of separately observed individuals, each of whom reports for a very short time on a particular topic, in a very specific experi­ mental set‐up. (For surveys of the experimental data see (Kraut 1980; Zuckerman et al. 1981; DePaulo et al. 1985; ekman and O’Sullivan 1991; bond and DePaulo 2006). even u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 99 if the soundness of these results is accepted, to infer from them to the sweeping general claim that ordinary people do not monitor effectively for truthfulness of the testimony they encounter in their everyday environments (the denial of eC), requires the additional premise that the T‐environments of the experiments, and those of T‐recipients in their everyday transactions, are similar in terms of what challenges –what manner of easily‐ encountered false testimony  –  they threaten. Nothing in the experimental data itself supports this premise, and first‐off it seems more likely to be false. In any case the exper­ imental findings are mixed, rather than consistently negative. ekman et al. (1999) find individual variation, some individuals doing quite well at detecting lying, others less well. Zuckerman et al. (1984) find improvement in detection of lying of particular individuals by experimental subjects, when given feedback on their success/failure. I have suggested that the empirical findings cited by Shieber, since they concern recip­ ients’ lack of effective filtering capacities in certain very specific testimonial situations, do not demonstrate, or even make probable, the thesis that ordinary recipients of testimony do not possess an effective filter which allows them to satisfy the modal reliability condi­ tion of R‐NeC, in their typical everyday social environments. A worry may be raised here thus: “True, the data which show that recipients of testimony are bad at detecting lying concern studies in a very specific experimental setting; but the nature of the findings may nonetheless be such that it is likely that they will carry over to other situations in which testimony is given and received.” One reason to doubt this, is that liars are not all alike. They all share a deceptive intent; but they will be more or less practiced in the art of effective deception  –  as our schoolgirl toy example above illustrated. Supporting the worry are the empirical studies which find that the features that are in fact tell‐tale signs of lying are different from those which folk‐theory about lying believes to be key. In particular the studies indicate that sustained eye‐contact is not, as folk wisdom has it, a sign of truth telling (Stiff and Miller 1989). There is an important general reason why the results from the studies are of only marginal relevance to the truth or otherwise of eC. The studies are explicitly aimed at investigating how good subjects are at detecting when a speaker is lying from cues observ­ able in her demeanor. This is their topic. but when we turn to whether a T‐recipient has an effective filter against false testimony she may encounter in her everyday environment, her method is not confined to these limited materials. An effective T‐method for detecting, or suspecting, lying, will for starters draw on the T‐recipient’s background knowledge – both general social knowledge, and specifics of the testifier in question. A discriminating, non‐gullible T‐recipient will approach an instance of testimony in the light of her empir­ ically based assessment of whether this type of person is generally truthful about this type of subject; whether this particular testifier has a past record of mendacity; and, most crucially, whether a plausible interpretation of her purposes and projects in speaking gives her a motive to lie. This is a wealth of relevant information available as input to assessment of likely mendacity, quite independent of whatever tell‐tale signs may or may not be present in the testifier’s demeanor. If awareness of these factors – very possibly achieved without conscious attention  –  is enough to cause the non‐gullible recipient to take the offered testimony “with a pinch of salt” – that is, not to simply believe it outright, then this is enough to avoid gullibility, and failure to satisfy Reliability. Cues in behavior are 100 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y not the be‐all and end‐all in assessing for likely mendacity; and options for doxastic response are not confined to: accept outright, or reject entirely. This I think shows up one way in which the typical purpose of the empirical work makes it not directly relevant to the issue of the modal reliability, in everyday situations, of recipients’ T‐methods. The study (ekman and O’Sullivan 1991) of whether police interrogators and other similar professionals can tell on the basis of perceptual cues which, out of a series of otherwise very similar speakers on the same topic, are in fact lying, looks for the presence of a very fine‐grained discriminatory capacity. This is not the same issue at all, as the one sketched above – whether and how ordinary recipients of testimony, in ordinary social situations, can engage in relatively coarse‐grained, but mostly effective, sifting of types of testifier by social role and other social‐background cues, together with deployment of everyday folk‐ psychological know‐how to estimate the speaker’s likely purposes in speaking, and thence whether she has a motive to lie. If it were the case that one gains knowledge through perception only if one’s perceptu­ ally based beliefs are modally reliable; and if the test for this were whether one would be able to tell if one were being deceived by an incredibly powerful demon intent on deceiv­ ing one, then, inevitably one would not be modally reliable, hence not knowledgeable, in believing anything much more than that one exists. but, as is familiar, this supremely high standard is not apt, except perhaps in certain very specific contexts, for assessing the reliability of perception. equally: if one gains knowledge through accepting testimony only if one’s T‐method is modally reliable; and if the test for this is whether one would be gulled into acceptance by a perfect liar, one whose motives one had no antecedent reason to suspect, then inevitably one would not be justified in believing anything on the basis of another’s testimony. but, as with perception, this supremely demanding test is not the epistemically apt one to invoke, as a standard for knowledge. Nor is it the usual, and correct, interpretation of R‐NeC. I have focused so far on the detection of lying, since this is the focus of the empirical studies. but competence or its lack – being knowledgeable about her topic – is no less important a factor than sincerity in the overall trustworthiness of a testifier. We all are often more at risk of encountering testimony that is false due to incompetence, than to mendacity. Shieber cites experimental findings concerning this also. Here, I think the findings give grounds as much for optimism as for pessimism, about the effectiveness of ordinary T‐recipients’ current strategies and capacities. Several studies found that, in assessing informants for competence, recipients are sensitive not (per impossibile) to competence itself, but to the social trappings and concomitants of competence. Thus, people presenting themselves as doctors, and appropriately attired, are believed on medi­ cal topics more than those who present as inexpert laypersons; those in a guard’s uniform are obeyed more readily than those in work‐clothes (bickman 1974). This strategy, though in epistemically (and socially) unfavorable situations it would not lead to detecting incom­ petence, is an apt implementable strategy, in socially and epistemically favorable situa­ tions: Who should one believe as to what is wrong with one  –  the doctor, or one’s neighbour? Whose instructions should one follow, as to what to do when fired shots are heard in an airport – the security guard, or another traveller? It is simply an instance of the inevitable general strategy in non‐omniscient knowledge‐seeking beings, for gaining u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 101 knowledge about non‐immediately perceptible features of the world. A creature in a forest seeking food eats plants with a certain appearance generally correlated with wholesome­ ness, and flees from other creatures similar in appearance to dangerous predators. In the supermarket, I look for marmalade, by looking for jars of the appropriate size and appear­ ance with labels saying “marmalade.” Similarly, and with no less epistemic aptitude, I trust the man at the garage in mechanic’s overalls, oily and holding a spanner, about what is wrong with my car – and so forth. While not an infallible procedure – and, ex hypothesi, not one that will be effective in identifying professional incompetence  –  this is an epistemically effective strategy, in a moderately epistemically benevolent and socially well‐ordered world: one in which my doctor has diagnosed my common complaint suc­ cessfully, and my confident but inexpert and paranoid neighbour has not. It is not an effective strategy in an epistemically and medically disastrous world, where medical schools turn out money‐grabbing and incompetent professionals. (We will return to the significance of this point in section 4.) but – as I have sought to highlight – a T‐recipient needs a T‐method with a filter effective in the epistemic and social environment she finds herself in; not one proof against socio‐epistemic demon‐worlds. We have seen that the experimental data cited by Shieber do not relate directly to the typical epistemic predicament of ordinary recipients of testimony on commonplace everyday topics. We have seen also that how powerful a filter a T‐recipient’s T‐method must incorporate, to be effective, is a function of her socio‐epistemic environment.xxxii This suggests that our original empirical claim eC is too sweeping to be a good candidate for a law‐like generalization, whether true or false. Whether individual T‐recipients in a particular culture, society or more specific local social context mostly satisfy eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR will turn on the nature of that culture, society or specific social context. So an empirical claim on the lines of eC is best formulated as an empirical proposition about such a particular culture, society or context. And, I conjecture, some of these context‐ relativized versions of eC will be true, others false  –  turning on the contingent and variable cultural norms and practices surrounding the production and reception of testi­ mony across these contexts. In a cultural environment that is epistemically favorable, that is to say false testimony is rare and bears easily recognisable signs, then eC is likely to be satisfied with respect to it. In one where hard‐to‐detect false testimony abounds, or where the socially reinforced epistemic norms governing acceptance are very uncritical, it will very likely be false. I have argued that the studies Shieber cites do not provide premises for a safe inference to the conclusion that eC – better, many of its many relativizations – is false. but eC may yet be predominantly false nonetheless. How much trouble would this engender, for R‐NeC? My next section considers this question. 3 Finessing the Non‐Skeptical Constraint We saw that R‐NeC together with Strong‐NSC entails the empirical claim eC: “Human recipients of testimony in normal society generally employ a T‐method including an effective filter by means of which they would detect and block belief in relevant‐alternative 102 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y false testimonies – ones they might easily encounter.” In the previous section we saw that the evidence from the studies cited by Shieber does not demonstrate eC to be false, or even render this probable. This does not, of course, show that eC is true; our interim conclusion is that the matter remains open to further inquiry. but suppose that further empirical studies were securely to establish the following: ordinary recipients of testimony are quite often in environments where they, as things stand, do not employ a T‐method that provides an effective filter in that environ­ ment  –  that is, there are currently many actual socio‐epistemic environments, and T‐recipients embedded in them, relative to which eC is false. This would mean that, unless we give up on R‐NeC, Strong‐NSC (“most of the beliefs that normal people form through their regular everyday acceptance of testimony are knowledge”) would not be satisfied. Would this be enough to precipitate a crisis for reliabilist epistemology, suggest­ ing R‐NeC must go? I shall now explain why it would not do so. I suggested in section 1 that it is non‐negotiable to accept that testimony is a source of knowledge – that is, that people, members of human societies, are able sometimes to get knowledge at second‐hand by means of testimony. but this compelling thought does not entail Strong‐NSC, but only a weaker non‐skeptical constraint: Weak‐NSC: Testimony for humans potentially can be, and sometimes is, a source of knowledge. Strong‐NSC portrays current everyday habits and practices of testimony‐reception as epistemically apt, furnishing belief apt to be knowledge, just as they currently are. but Weak‐NSC does not entail that we must endorse current social norms and attitudes to testimony, including recipients’ receptive practices, as epistemically ideal just as they are, with no scope for improvement. epistemology is of small interest if it is not normative; and its proposed norms are of small interest if we hold a meta‐epistemology which entails that all the philosopher can ever do is to slavishly record and put a seal of approval on present‐day epistemic habits and practices. To endorse Weak‐NSC as compelling is one thing. We should not move from there to the feeble view that one cannot challenge and criticize current everyday epistemic habits and practices; and that our normative episte­ mology of testimony is constrained to come up with the result that all, or anyway most, instances of actual testimony‐reception are normatively apt, and apt to result in knowl­ edge. Strong‐NSC, while it may possibly turn out to be satisfied ex post, is not a binding ex ante constraint on an adequate normative epistemology of testimony. The upshot of the confrontation of armchair normative theorizing with the results of empirical research about typical present‐day epistemic habits, including testimony‐reception, could turn out to be a critique that suggests present habits are far from epistemically perfect. For all we yet know (and as we may well suspect!) socially reinforced and maintained epistemic habits and culture in relation to testimony are epistemically defective both as regards modal reliability, and as regards doxastic responsibility. Relative to the epistemic goal of attaining true belief while avoiding error, we may find ourselves concluding, habits need to change. Testimony‐recipients may need to be warned, informed, educated, to do better than they currently do. Specifically, we might find that many recipients are needlessly u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 103 gullible, open to being deceived, and that – relative to the epistemic goal of attaining true belief while avoiding error – they would do well to learn to be more suspicious and dis­ criminating, and more circumspect xxxiii. Weak‐NSC is, however, compelling. This being so, it would precipitate a crisis for normative armchair epistemology of testimony, and specifically for R‐NeC, if it were shown both that: a) It is a robust and irremediable empirical feature of human testimony, that there is lots of lying and/or incompetence across nearly all societies; and also that b) Humans are constitutionally incapable of learning to respond discriminatingly to testimony. If both (a) and (b) were empirically established, the catastrophic conclusion – catastrophic for the human race no less than for reliabilist‐minded epistemologists – would follow that the empirical facts preclude eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR and hence Reliability being satisfied, in relation to any instances of testimony. We would then face a choice between dropping R‐NeC – to allow that knowledge is gained from some instances of true testimony that are believed; or espousing skepticism about testimony as a source of any knowledge at all. Fortunately the catastrophic conclusion is not even remotely probable. It is hard to see how (b) could be empirically proven. True, some empirical studies show people tend to be over­ confident of their own abilities, and to respond badly to critique of them xxxiv. but the human animal is supremely the learning animal. It is hard not to think that humans are, at the very worst, capable of learning, through confrontation with conclusive evidence, that they are bad at telling who is lying in a given situation, so that they should suspend judgment on this  matter; and acting on what they have learned. This is all that it takes to prevent the formation of modally unreliable belief, in violation of R‐NeC. xxxv We saw in section 2 that the cognitive demands on a recipient, for her to embody an effective filter are more or less taxing, according to what manner of false testimony might easily be encountered by her; eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR being trivially fulfilled in a T‐environment in which there is no false testimony easily encountered. This suggests evading the catastrophic conclusion by denying its other premise, (a). The nature of the socio‐epistemic environment, in particular social and institutional norms governing the giving of testimony, and sanctioning defective testimony, is not an unalterable given. even if human nature cannot be changed, human social arrangements are eminently subject to flux and alteration, in this case with benign intention. This thought will be pursued further in my final section. The considerations of this section underwrite and strengthen the case for the conclu­ sion we came to in section 2: there is no crisis for R‐NeC precipitated by the empirical studies of human testimony‐reception cited by Shieber. In section 2 we saw that eC is not disconfirmed by them. In this section we have seen that even if eC were falsified, this would not force the abandonment of R‐NeC, since only Weak‐NSC is a compelling ex ante constraint on an adequate normative epistemology of testimony. It would not be out‐of‐bounds if the confrontation of normative epistemology with empirical data were to yield the conclusion that there is room for improvement, from the epistemic standpoint, in current practices as to both the production and reception of testimony. 104 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y We have found that the need to avoid an unacceptable degree of scepticism about testimony as a source of knowledge does not force the abandonment of R‐NeC in relation to testimony. but this does not show that modal reliability is in fact an apt necessary con­ dition for testimonial knowledge. In section  4 I develop a more classic a priori line of thought, presenting a series of cases which I shall attempt to persuade you make the requirement of modal reliability of a belief, for it to be knowledge, seem over‐strong in relation to testimony. before this, I make a brief digression to contrast R‐NeC/ eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR with internalist accounts of justified testimonial belief that trade in doxastic responsibility rather than modal reliability. A normative epistemology of testimony may place lesser or greater cognitive demands on a recipient, as required for a belief she forms through accepting testimony to be justified, and hence potentially knowledge xxxvi. label as Blind Trust the T‐method of a recipient who uncritically accepts and forms belief in whatever she is told, whomsoever by. unqualified blind Trust is not a coherent stance – since one may simultaneously receive inconsistent testimonies from different people. To preserve minimal coherence in the blind truster’s cognitive economy, she must be sensitive to the most blatant defeaters of the received testimony. As well as contrary testimony, these include being told by another source that the testifier is lying; or already having conclusive evidence, such as excellent perception, of the falsity of what is testified to. Suppose blind Trust to be refined to cope with these points. So far as I am aware, no writer on testimony has subscribed to the view that blind Trust is an epistemically apt attitude. The fundamentalist positions we exam­ ined in section 1, K‐SuFF and DeFJuS, both require sensitivity to defeaters, which we may interpret as extending beyond the bare minimum required to avoid glaring incoher­ ence. Further defeaters of the supposed presumptive justification to accept as true what one is told include various obvious warning signs that the testimony is untrustworthy: grounds to think the person has a motive to lie; a previous track record of bad faith or inaccuracy; knowing they are not in a position to know about the topic; and so forth. epistemologically internalist approaches place requirements for justified belief forma­ tion through testimony designed to ensure that the belief in question satisfies conditions of doxastic responsibility/epistemic rationality. A subject forms a belief responsibly/ration­ ally if and only if she has grounds or reason to think it likely to be true, from her own epistemic perspective.Internalist fundamentalists hold that it is enough for this condition to hold, that the recipient has no defeaters for the testimony.They maintain that testimony has intrinsic credibility, and so justifies acceptance by its own light, so long as this is not defeated. Internalist reductionists instead hold that the word of another is not intrinsically credible, so that one rationally accepts a proposition on the basis of testimony to it only if one has specific positive empirical grounds to trust that testifier about her present topic. xxxvii We saw in section 1 that fundamentalist conditions for justified belief through testi­ mony do not ensure that a subject forming belief in accordance with them satisfies a modal reliability condition. A testifier could give true, knowledgeable testimony, and a recipient, having no defeaters for it, form belief in it, properly according to DeFJuS; while in fact the testifier might easily have given false testimony, which the recipient would equally have believed. The same holds for the reductionist internalist requirement. A recipient could have excellent positive reasons to trust a piece of testimony, and nothing u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 105 against doing so; while in fact the testifier, though speaking truly from knowledge, might easily have lied undetectably about the same or a similar topic. There is no question of getting knowledge that P from testimony that P, when P is false. but when the testimony is true, and the recipient has excellent positive reasons to believe the testimony, and none against – does it really prevent her coming to know that P, simply because the testifier easily might have told her something false instead, and the recipient would have believed her? R‐NeC gives an affirmative answer to this question. In these circumstances the recipient’s belief, though entirely epistemically rational, and true in virtue of its source in the testimony, is not modally reliable. In the next section I will question whether modal reliability as formulated in Reliability is really such a good idea, as a necessary condition on testimonially based belief, for it to be knowledge. 4 Justification Without Reliability? Goldman (1976) theorizes knowledge as belief formed by a modally reliable process or method, such methods being individuated narrowly. eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR formulates what this requires of a recipient of testimony. We saw in section 2 that how powerful a subject’s internal filter (her narrow T‐method) needs to be depends on how epistemically favorable or otherwise her T‐environment is – what manner of false testimony she might easily encounter, and so must be able to detect. At one extreme, in a testimony demon‐ world, filled with randomly distributed perfect liars and incompetents, even the most powerful possible narrow T‐method would not be able to ensure modal reliability. At the other, blind Trust is a modally reliable T‐method, in an environment where one encoun­ ters only true testimony. equally, one whose narrow T‐method is blind Trust will satisfy modal reliability if she is everywhere accompanied by a Guardian Angel, who intervenes to convince her of the contrary truth or block belief, if any false testimony is offered. blind Trust does not seem a very good T‐Method, even for someone who has a Guardian Angel. To reveal what is epistemically weak about blind Trust we can evaluate (narrow) T‐methods not just in terms of their modal reliability in the recipient’s actual environment, but across a range of possible environments.xxxviii blind Trust does badly once a range of Guardianless, and less‐than‐ideally favorable testimony‐environments are included. We may say that a T‐method is robustly modally reliable if it has modal reliability across a good range of possible T‐environments. A T‐recipient with a robustly reliable T‐method is better equipped epistemically than one with a merely actually‐reliable T‐method. (Think of ella’s move of school, and my move to a new bird‐watching location.) A T‐recipient’s T‐method will be the more robustly reliable, the more the burden of ensuring reliability is taken by apt sensitivity to cues (both perceptible features of the testimony, and relevant background information) in her internal filter, rather than being due to contingent beneficial features of her environ­ ment. If I would succeed in blocking belief in the false testimony I might easily receive, only in virtue of the fact that a constant companion to whom I defer would interrupt and advise me of the fact, whenever I am given false testimony, this is not a robustly reliable T‐method – take away my companion, and I am easily duped. The more powerful my 106 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y internal filter, the greater the range of increasingly unfavorable T‐environments in which my T‐method will still satisfy modal reliability. There could equally be negative environmental interference messing up the outputs of an otherwise quite robustly reliable internal filter. Consider the converse of the Guardian Angel set‐up: I discriminate false testimony on the basis of perceptual cues. but when I encounter, and detect, a false testimony, my Host Demon interrupts and provides me with misleading but persuasive defeaters for the falsity of the testimony. The Guardian Angel and Host Demon count as features of my variable environment, not as part of my T‐method, given our narrow individuation of methods. but if an outside‐my‐skin device is bound always to be with me, one could instead individuate my T‐method to include this external device. This is surely a good theory choice, for instance, for the visual‐perception method of short‐sighted people who always wear glasses. It could be so also, for someone who always receives testimony along with her effective lie‐detector machine.xxxix A robustly reliable T‐filter is more powerful epistemic equipment than a solely actual‐ world reliable filter. Our present project is to question whether even actual‐world reliabil­ ity is needed in all testimony cases which intuitively count as knowledge. Consider the case of Cyril and Maud. Cyril’s spouse Maud is having an affair. Occasionally she comes home late having been with her lover. More often she comes home late after staying late at the office to finish urgent work. In either case she tells Cyril that she has stayed late at the office to work. She has always been an exemplary spouse until this recent affair, and Cyril has lots of track‐record evidence of her past honesty and competence. He has no reason to suspect anything currently. Maud is a very adept liar, good at dissembling. Cyril cannot tell from her demeanor when she is lying, and harbors suspicions neither of her mendacity nor of her unfaithfulness. All this being so, Cyril is entirely doxastically responsible and evidentially sensitive in his acceptance of his wife’s reports of where she has been. He satisfies even a strong reductionist internalist requirement of possessing positive grounds to treat Maud’s testimony as truthful. Of course Cyril does not get knowledge of where Maud has been when she lies to him and he believes her false report. but what of the good case, when Maud sincerely and truly tells him that she has been working late? His belief is true and doxastically responsible; but it fails our modal reliability condition – she might easily have lied, and he would still have believed her. My intuition is that in the good case, when Maud is telling the truth, Cyril comes to know through her testimony that she was working late at the office. If this is right, then our usual modal reliability condition on knowledge Reliability is incorrect, at least for testimony. (Of course, if Cyril comes to know that Maud is having an affair and sometimes lies to him about where she has been, that additional knowledge will undermine his trust in her testimony, even when she is telling the truth. because this defeater has come within his ken, the internal doxastic responsibility condition now kicks in, and if rational he will no longer be entirely confident in trusting her word. even if he were still to trust her this would be epistemically irrational, and so his belief would not be knowledge. Such loss of knowledge through coming to know misleading factual defeaters is a familiar phenomenon, and is not a reason to deny knowledge when the believer remains ignorant of the misleading factual defeaters.) u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 107 We can play around with details here, and intuitions maybe shift a bit. Suppose Maud is nearly always with her lover, and by small chance this is the one occasion when she was at the office, and speaks truly. Or suppose she tells Cyril truly “I was at the cinema with a friend from work.” This is true – her lover is from work, and we may suppose counts as a friend. but Cyril might easily have asked who the friend was, in which case she would have lied and said it was her colleague Jane – relevantly similar false testimony. My intui­ tion is that Cyril gets knowledge from acceptance of Maud’s testimony in all of these cases. but I think it is especially hard to deny it, in our first and third cases. xl Why do we think this? (I address those who share my intuition, and invite others to join us!) Consider the following scenarios. I need urgently to get my prescription from the chemist. I by fluke get to the chemist just before it closes, but only because (unbeknown to me) today is late‐closing day. Or: I go by chance to the only chemist that has the prescription; all the others in town do not stock it. In these cases I get the goods I need not through my own powers, but only due to lucky chance. It could easily have been that I failed to get them. but I did get the goods nonetheless. Some knowledge‐getting cases are uncontroversially like this. by chance, I catch a glimpse of the burglar as he leaves, and recognize him. So I know it was Tom Farley. If I’d not seen him, I would have falsely believed it was Jonas Perkins. This case is of course not a counterexample to R‐NeC; Reliability is satisfied. My belief is not brute‐modally‐reliable, but it is so relative to my method: visually‐based perceptual recognition. I got the goods, I got knowledge, though only through a chance event; only through chance did I  have access to the epistemic link that enabled me to gain the knowledge. Testimony, I suggest, furnishes cases – those structurally similar to Cyril and Maud – where we have the same intuition – I got the goods, though only by chance. but in these testimony cases my belief does not satisfy Reliability. The belief is not modally reliable even relative to its method xli. There are several kinds of cases we can think up, concerning testimony, where (to start with an uncontroversial description) the subject gets a true belief from acceptance of testimony, but one which does not satisfy Reliability – she might easily have obtained a relevantly similar false belief, through acceptance of other relevantly similar testimony. They are all cases where Reliability is failed; but I think our intuitions discriminate between them. If I am right about this, then it is not just whether a modal reliability condition is failed that matters, but how and why it is failed: Reliability‐Failure Case One: I receive accidentally true testimony that P from a speaker who lacks knowledge, and has a true belief regarding P only by chance xlii. This speaker might easily have had a false belief about this topic, and would have misinformed me. Reliability‐Failure Case Two: I receive testimony from a speaker on a topic – say, locations of and routes to get to various streets in east Oxford. I ask her where Marston Street is, to which she knows and gives me the correct answer. I might easily have asked her about another street, about which she would not have known, and would have answered confidently but incorrectly. In this second case we have a speaker who speaks from knowledge, but accidentally so. She might easily have instead given relevantly‐similar 108 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y false testimony. There are many variants we can spin on this, for instance Cyril and Maud above. Reliability‐Failure Case Three: I solicit information from an honest and knowledge­ able speaker, who is extremely reliable about all the topics I might easily ask her about. but I am in an environment where she is the only reliable informant, and there are many wholly unreliable informants around. It is only by chance that I asked the knowl- edgeable speaker, and not one of the unreliable ones. xliii Variants on this last example abound, not all of them types of testimony. I happen to consult the only accurate travel guide amongst many highly erroneous ones; the only reliable TV news channel among many; the only accurate clock amongst many inaccurate ones… and so forth.xliv I think Case Three is that in which we are most inclined to ascribe knowledge, despite the failure of Reliability, and Case One is that in which we are least inclined to. Why is this? Many writers about testimony have emphasized the idea that by testifying, a knower is able to pass on her knowledge to another person, the recipient. I think we are sure that the recipient’s true belief in Case One is not knowledge, because the speaker had no knowledge to pass on. She does not get the goods, because the speaker has no goods to give to her. In contrast, in both Case Two and Case Three, the speaker expresses her knowledge in speaking. I think there is a strong intuition here that the speaker has the goods, she makes available what she has, and so the recipient is able to get them from her – even if she might easily not have been able to. We conceive the situation analogously to the lucky success in getting the needed medicine from the chemist. This way of describing the situation, and diagnosing our intuitions, is specific to testi­ mony. We could diagnose slightly differently. Goldman (1979) suggests that the processes we regard as yielding justified belief are just the reliable ones. My proposal is that we adapt a version of this idea to give a novel twist to the reliabilist account of knowledge, as follows. We have a folk ontology of reliable sources of belief, thought of by the folk as ways in which we can and often do get knowledge. These include perception, memory and the testimony of other people. These, I now conjecture, are in our folk‐ontology of ways you can get knowledge due to their perceived reliability across a broad range of the environ­ ments we are used to, and with respect to which we calibrate them. They are, as it were, on our folk‐list of approved methods of getting knowledge. (In this respect they contrast with various folk‐ways of not getting knowledge – wishful thinking, consulting tea‐leaves, and so forth.) learning that P through being told by someone who knows is a way of getting knowledge that P; and this remains true even if this occurred only due in part to good luck. If this diagnosis and its implications is accepted, then Reliability is rejected as a necessary condition for knowledge. but the spirit of reliabilism is maintained, since it is the believed general reliability of a source of belief that gets it onto our approved folk‐list of ways in which knowledge is obtained, in the first place xlv. What is dropped is the idea that a method must be reliable in the actual world, the actual situation of a particular believer’s belief‐formation, in order to yield her knowledge in that situation. We use reliability considerations to fix our list of approved ways of getting knowledge; and then we judge that knowledge is gained in any instance in which one of these folk‐approved u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 109 ways functions normally to yield a true belief  –  even if a freakily bad epistemic environment means that actual‐world modal reliability is not satisfied. Clocks that keep accurate time yield knowledge of what time it is when consulted, and one gets knowledge from consulting a reliable TV news channel or book, or a knowledgeable speaker – even in a situation where one might easily have instead consulted an unreliable one – I get the goods, even though I might easily have failed to. Adopting this novel version of reliabilism – Approved‐List Reliabilism – would not mean accepting as correct the fundamentalist principles K‐SuFF and DeFJuS. The internalist requirement of doxastic responsibility still applies, and the debate between fundamentalists versus reductionists over whether this requires positive reasons for acceptance of testimony, or only apt sensitivity to defeaters, remains exactly where it previously stood. It does have revisionary implications for our view of what it takes to get perceptual knowledge. If all that is needed for getting knowledge is the normal operation of an approved method for getting knowledge, then contrary to what may be described as the received view, dating from Goldman (1976), even when passing through fake‐barn country, a normal perceiver Roberta comes to know that there is a barn before her on the basis of perception, so long as she has a perceptual capacity for barns in normal, non‐ freakish situations. If the presence of many fake barns is a one‐off, then this does not impugn Roberta’s knowledge. Clearly, this suggestion needs much fuller investigation, but I will deviate from my main topic no further in the present chapter. (It matters that the fake‐barn set‐up is a freakish one‐off. If it is a stable feature of Roberta’s ongoing environment, the place where she has grown up and that she resides in, that there are both real and fake barns she may easily encounter, and she cannot tell them apart on the basis of perception, then she does not have a perceptually based recognitional capacity for barns at all. It is plausible that the representational content of perceptual experience is externalistically individuated, so that the concept “barn” is liable to feature in Roberta’s perceptual contents just if she has a perceptually based discriminatory capac­ ity for barns – that is to say, she can tell them apart from the alternatives she encounters in her usual environment. It is the same with our example of robins/bobbins. I can tell robins apart from the alternatives that show up in my usual environment (my garden), and so I have a perceptually based recognitional capacity for robins, and the concept “robin” features in the representational content of my perception, when I spot a robin. When I go on holiday I am still liable to have the perceptual content “robin” – there is some inertia here – but it is prompted also by bobbins and so I am fooled. If I stay long enough in the new environment, and fail to learn to tell robins from bobbins, my perceptions will no longer bear their former representational content, and will cease to feature “robin.” It will no longer be true, as it once was, to say of me when I am visually confronted with a robin: it visually seems to her as if there is a robin before her.) Hesitations over whether Cases One to Three and other intuition‐testing scenarios are instances of knowledge do not reflect uncertainty as to the underlying normative facts. One who has a robustly reliable T‐method is better equipped epistemically than one who has a solely actual‐world reliable one; one who has a belief that is modally reliable is better epistemically placed than one who forms a true belief in circumstances where she might 110 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y easily have formed a similar but false one. Our hesitations are over precisely where, in the graded scale of epistemic well‐offness, to place the cut‐off for knowledge. A richer, less knowledge‐obsessed epistemology will not agonize over the placement of the cut‐off, but will develop accounts of a range of weaker and stronger epistemic virtues. Attributions of knowledge or its lack are a coarse‐grained all‐or‐nothing snapshot from a more complex normative landscape. They play a central role in our everyday projects and purposes – as regards others, whom to consult, and trust, about a topic (see Craig 1990); as regards ourselves, when to act decisively on putative information, and when instead to seek further evidence or second opinion (see Hawthorne 2004; Stanley 2005); and so forth. Hence knowledge is a central category in our folk‐epistemic thinking. but our pragmatically oriented attributions of knowledge are driven by various potentially conflicting intuitions, from which different ones will be more salient, and drive our verdict, in different scenarios. Hence our verdicts are interest‐driven and highly context‐sensitive. We should not expect principled determinacy and stability to characterize our folk‐intuitions about the distribution of knowledge. Thus, for instance, we hesitate as to whether Cyril knows Maud has been working late – he has learned the truth from a folk‐approved knowledge source, but his belief is not modally reliable. In fake‐barn country, a normal perceiver with a recognitional capacity for barns in her usual, more epistemically favorable environments, sees a barn before her and forms belief that she is confronted with a barn, but her belief is not modally reliable, due to a one‐off bad‐epistemic‐luck environment. She enjoys a normal instance of a folk‐approved method of getting knowledge, but in abnormal and peculiarly unfavorable circumstances. My aim in this discussion is not to pronounce categorically on whether actual‐world modal reliability is necessary for knowledge, but to clarify what is at stake. I am inclined to share the verdict of Gendler and Hawthorne (2005) that we should not expect to find a unified theory that yields a correct answer covering all cases, or at least no unique all‐purpose answer from the folk, to this question. I do maintain that when we turn to testimony, Case Two and Case Three above look like cases of knowledge, so that the standard modal reliability condition Reliability appears over‐strong. When you know something, and tell it to me to share your knowledge with me, and I with doxastic responsibility accept what you tell me, you pass on your knowledge to me. This is so even if you or some other nearby person might easily have instead lied to me, and I would still have believed you or her. The account of knowledge I have proposed has this upshot. All that is needed for getting knowledge is the normal operation of an approved method for getting knowledge. More strictly, all that is needed for getting knowledge accord­ ing to the folk, is the normal operation of a folk‐approved method for getting knowledge xlvi. I have further suggested that the folk‐approved‐list is selected on the basis of perceived general reliability. The suggestion made here is only a pointer towards a possible fully worked out account of knowledge that incorporates reliability in a novel way. xlvii Much must be said about what constitutes the “normal operation” of an approved method. There is the generic method, for example, visual perception; forming belief through acceptance of testimony; addition; and then there is the particular believer’s instantiation of that method. A “normal opera­ tion” of the method will involve a competency condition on the believer, and this latter u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 111 will surely somehow involve reliability of process. The force and point of the present proposal is that this condition will not entail modal reliability – not even method‐relativized modal reliability – of the employed method in the actual situation of belief formation, when that is anomalously unfavorable. My focus has been on whether actual‐world method‐relativized modal reliability as captured in Reliability is necessary for knowledge, and I have claimed the verdict of intuition is that it is not, in the case of testimony. In Cases One to Three the subject fails Reliability, but ex hypothesi satisfies a correct doxastic responsibility condition on formation of belief through acceptance of testimony. Another topic, not addressed here, is what a correct such condition amounts to  –  the familiar issue of Reductionism versus Fundamentalism about testimony. even doxastic responsibility can seem a very strong condition on gaining knowledge from testimony – does one never learn from what one is told, even from a truthful and competent speaker, just because one would not respond with full apt sensitivity to defeaters, if they were encountered? I leave this question for another day xlviii. Is there trouble for Approved‐List Reliabilism (AlR) over the question whether testimony is indeed a sufficiently reliable source of belief? No. AlR does not turn on the fact of the empirical issue, since what it offers is a story about how our folk‐list is derived; so it is folk belief that matters, not the reality of the situation. And the folk count testi­ mony as a way of getting knowledge – it is on the folk‐list. In fact, I have argued (Fricker 1994) that the blanket generalization “testimony is generally reliable” is not a good candi­ date for a law‐like generalization. It is much more specific sub‐types of testimony, typed by speaker, and topic, and  –  as we have seen in this paper  –  social context, for which significant generalizations may be sought. I finish this section with some further thoughts about individuation of methods. We remarked that this is crucial for reliabilism. A T‐recipient has an effective filter if she would detect and block relevantly similar false testimony that she might easily have received via the same method. Is the method: receiving any testimony, from any speaker? Or: receiving any testimony from that very speaker? Or: receiving any testimony on simi­ lar topics from that/any speaker? I have here assumed that the method is carved broadly, as “receiving testimony”; but this might be debated. equally, what is “relevantly similar” other testimony – suppose my garage mechanic is reliable about cars, but not about driving directions. I would believe him on either. Does this mean my belief about my car’s state derived from trusting his word is not modally reliable? The finer‐grained the method, and the narrower the class of relevantly similar beliefs, the easier it will be, in most cases, for a recipient’s belief to come out modally reliable. A disjunctivist individuation of methods would render Reliability trivially fulfilled in all cases where a normal operation of a method yields true belief. xlix A disjunctivist account of perception holds that in the good case, veridical perception, the subject enjoys a method of finding out about the world, a form of epistemic contact with it, which she simply does not have access to in the bad case, misperception, despite its indiscriminability by the subject from the good case (see Haddock and Macpherson 2008). Disjunctivist‐style individuation of methods renders reliability trivially fulfilled in any good case. We saw above how one gets knowledge only by chance when one gets the opportunity to use a 112 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y certain reliable method only by chance. In our example above, I chance to get a glimpse of the burglar, and employ my modally reliable method of visual recognition to recognize him, as he leaves. My belief satisfies method‐relativized modal reliability – the bad nearby case in which I get a false belief is one in which I don’t get the chance to employ the method. In the classic fake‐barn case of Goldman (1976), individuating the method as “visual perception” entails that the same method is involved both in recognizing barns, and mis‐recognizing fake barns as barns; and, in Goldman’s scenario, it is not modally reliable. but if we were to individuate the method as “gaining perceptual knowledge,” or “perceptually recognizing an item,” then it would be trivially reliable. (Compare the case where the bad relevant alternatives are all percept‐indistinguishable barn hallucinations.) I am not inclined to disjunctivism, and this would strike me as a cheap trick for reliabi­ lism. However, it may be that our intuition about getting the goods, though one might easily have failed to do so, has a kind of disjunctivist feel behind it. In the case of testimony, learning that p from someone who knows is the disjunctivist conception of the epistemic link. That way of getting beliefs is necessarily modally reliable! 5 Conclusion: The Need for Social Epistemology We saw in section 2 that the empirical studies cited by Shieber do not provide any strong evidence that ordinary T‐recipients in their everyday situations fail to embody a T‐method with a filter effective for their actual environment. We nonetheless suggested in section 4 that modal reliability as usually understood is an implausibly strong condition on testimo­ nial knowledge. Testimony is a way of getting knowledge, and a person who with doxastic responsibility accepts knowledgeable testimony gets knowledge, even if she narrowly missed a bad case in which she would encounter and be duped by false testimony. We proposed Approved‐List Reliabilism as a new general theory of knowledge which incorporates reliabilist intuitions, but at a different point. We observed also that the more powerful a filter a subject’s T‐method involves, the greater the range of testimonial environments, including very unfavorable ones – ones including accomplished liars and incompetent professionals – in which she will still effec­ tively filter out false testimony, and reliably acquire only true beliefs from testimony. blind Trust is a reliable T‐method in an environment in which one is surrounded only by competent, sincere and epistemically cautious testifiers. Testimony is a two‐stage process, and whether its overall upshot is to equip the recipient consistently with only true beliefs depends on the character and more precisely, the aptness of fit between its two stages. We start with an analogy. Memory is also a two‐stage process. It involves first the laying down of stored informa­ tion in memory; second, the retrieval as needed of this information to furnish current belief. So far as I am aware it is not a standard position in the epistemology of memory that a remembering subject needs to subject her memories to a filter, accepting them at the moment of recall only if they pass some positive epistemic test. The analogy to epistemological Reductionism about testimony is not a current live position regarding memory. (Clearly, globally applicable standards of doxastic responsibility entail that one u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 113 should be alerted if an apparent memory conflicts with other things one knows.) but the absence of such a recall‐point filter means that memory is a reliable source of belief only so long as there is reliability at the stage in the process when memories are laid down. If humans were such that quite a lot of what got laid down in memory‐storage was incor­ rect, then overall reliability would require an appropriate filter at the recall stage. (We may suppose that quite a lot of imaginings got stored as memories, or that dreams regularly got stored as memories of real events.) What is required, for the whole two‐stage memory unit to reliably produce only true beliefs, is that the two stages fit together so that only true beliefs result from the accept­ ance of apparent‐memories. This is ensured by the pairing of an entirely uncritical acceptance of apparent‐memories at the moment of recall, with a 100% reliable laying‐ down process; or by a degree and kind of unreliability at the point of laying‐down, so long as this is matched by an aptly tuned filter to detect the duds, at the point of recall.l The same analysis applies to testimony. Testimony has as first stage the giving of testimony by a testifier, and as second stage its uptake by a hearer. What is needed for over­ all reliability, is that the filter at the second stage – the filter embodied in the recipient’s T‐method – is able to detect the duds, the false testimony, produced at the first stage. li Testimony will be a reliable source of beliefs for a recipient in a T‐environment e just if her T‐filter (narrow T‐method) is in this sense well‐matched to the testimony she is liable to encounter in e. (We may add that her T‐filter should also accept a reasonable percentage of the knowledgeable testimony she encounters. Rejecting everything one  is  told is a reliable, but not an epistemically advantageous attitude to testimony (see Goldman 1999: ch. 4)). The worse the T‐environment, the more powerful the recipient’s T‐filter needs to be, to ensure she accepts only true testimony. The better the T‐environment, the weaker a T‐filter the recipient can get away with, salva reliability. We can marry this observation with what I believe to be the intended overall drift of Sheiber’s discussion of testimony.lii If recipients tend to perform poorly at detecting lying and incompetence, then there are two different and potentially complementary ways in which one may seek to improve the overall epistemic situation. One could try to educate and train individual recipients of testimony to do better. Or one could seek to improve their testimonial environment – to find ways to prevent or inhibit the production of the types of false testimony that they sometimes encounter, and are unable to detect. One can work on the first stage, produc­ tion; and/or on the second stage, reception, to improve the overall reliability or veritistic value of testimony as an epistemic source (see Goldman 1999: ch. 4). The extent to which testifiers in a given institutional or social setting will be careful to obey governing social norms, most notably the norm that one should assert only what one knows to be true, will turn on how effective sanctions against false testimony are in that setting. Disapproval or disappointment of friends and associates gives an informal sanc­ tion. In professional settings, institutional norms and procedures can do more to put in place sanctions with serious bite. For instance, the balance between the temptation to massage data to demonstrate a result in the sciences, and the professional sanctions if this were to be found out, is a critical one. The crime of perjury – giving false witness under oath in court – takes the sanction to an extreme, in a situation when the need for truthful 114 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y testimony is paramount. This thought ends my investigation of reliability and reliabilism in relation to testimony pointing in an apt direction  –  towards the need and scope for social epistemology, a fast‐growing and hugely important field pioneered by that veteran philosophical explorer of new territory, Alvin Goldman. liii Notes i This paper was first drafted whilst the Olympic Games in london were taking place in August 2012, rendering such parallels cognitively salient to its author. ii Goldman 1979 focuses on epistemic justification, arguing that a belief is justified just if it is produced by a reliable process. However, since one can have a false justified belief, reli­ ability of processes that confers justification is explicated in terms of a high, but less than 100, percentage of truth of the resulting beliefs in a given world or worlds, rather than being explicated modally, as for knowledge. iii We do, I think, indeed find ourselves with a strong intuition favoring the modal anti‐luck requirement for knowledge when presented with some examples; Goldman (1976) tapped into this. However, my argument in section 4 proposes that this intuition is not stable: in other examples we reject it as ruling out what are, intuitively, cases of knowledge. iv This point is implicit in Goldman (1976), and is explicit in the classic development of a relia­ bilist account of knowledge in Nozick (1981). v Strictly: forms, or sustains, still on basis of her original source. There are differences crucial for some issues between epistemic dynamics versus statics, but these issues are not explored here. vi Making this equivalence means one must be prepared to bite this bullet: if which alternatives count as relevant is context‐sensitive, then so is talk of what might easily have occurred. I think this could be palatable, but the issues raised by contextualism are beyond the scope of the present inquiry. vii “Might easily” as used here is the complement to “not easily” as used in the explanation of a safety condition on knowledge in Sosa (2007). It is a modal notion, not a statistical or probabilistic notion. viii Goldman is, however, here concerned with reliability of processes as making for justification, not knowledge, and accordingly explicates it as a high percentage of true beliefs as output, not our modal conception. ix See Goldman (1979, 1986). Reliability making for justification may also be explicated modally, phrasing the constraint in terms of close worlds; but requiring that most, rather than all, of the close worlds are ones in which relevantly similar beliefs are true. x Also, when the proposition is a deeply entrenched nomological truth that could not easily be false, it could not easily be falsely believed. xi Non‐acceptance could consist either in outright rejection, or in forming some partial degree of belief short of full acceptance. Note that a person’s total cognitive apparatus in receiving testimony must also involve what we will, for present purposes, regard as a separate cognitive module, call it her U‐method, her method for understanding what she hears – identifying the force and content of the encountered speech act. Acquisition of reliably true beliefs from encountered testimony requires an effective u‐method as well as an effective T‐method. The role of successful interpretation of speech acts, and how failures at this point can generate unreliability, is a crucial further topic beyond the scope of this discussion. The supposition of isolation of a person’s u‐method and her T‐method is an interim simplifying assumption. u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 115 xii If we specify other “relevantly similar” beliefs more narrowly, e.g, confine the specification to other beliefs acquired from testimony about the same topic, we will get very different results when applying Reliability to testimony. e.g., suppose my mechanic reliably tells me only truths about my car, but is wildly out on driving directions; I would believe him on any topic, but I ask him about the condition of my car’s engine…Similarly, if we individuate the method as “believing testimony given by S,” where S is a particular individual or collection or type of individuals, rather than all potential informants, then modal reliability of this “method” will place different, typically less demanding, requirements. These alternate theo­ retical choices would alter the significance of the examples discussed in section 4. I think the relatively broad individuation of both method and other “relevantly similar” beliefs chosen here is apt, but there is not space to probe these issues. xiii Turning on how finely we individuate T‐environments, a subject may in fact have a range of normal T‐environments she frequents – workplace, home, and so forth. For ease of exposi­ tion I prescind from this detail in what follows. xiv TFP is not the negation of the universal generalization “testimony is generally reliable.” We have explicated reliability modally, not statistically. So TFP claims nothing about statistics, but rather that instances of testimony, as a type, are liable to have relevant alter­ natives of false testimony. elsewhere (Fricker 1994) I have argued that it is a mistake to attempt global generalizations about the reliability of otherwise of testimony, understood in statistical terms. xv Fricker 2006 argues that proper instances of testifying are those where the testifier expresses her knowledge; so this condition, rather than mere truth of testimony, is what the discrim­ inating recipient’s T‐method should be geared to detecting the presence or absence of. I mainly prescind from this detail in the present discussion. xvi To reiterate: satisfaction of eFFeCTIVe FIlTeR is by an ordered pair of a person (by virtue of her narrow T‐method), and her T‐environment. Her narrow T‐method must detect and block belief in all the false testimony which her T‐environment might present her with – this being the easily encountered false testimony. xvii That a recipient has a single T‐method that she deploys in relation to all instances of received testimony is a substantive assumption that could well be false. It could be, for instance, that she possesses two distinct testimony‐processing modules, call them WARy and uNWARy, and that one or the other (but not both) is activated on a given occasion of testimony‐reception. The present analysis could cope quite easily with this complication, but I do not attempt to include it in my main discussion. xviii extended testimony includes emails, letters, newspapers, the internet, all manner of pur­ portedly factual books, and so forth. Here we focus on the core case. xix The classic statement of and case for fundamentalism is Coady (1992). Wellbourne (1986), Ross (1986), burge (1993) are further key advocates. For an argument for “local” reduction­ ism see Fricker (1994). See also lyons (1997), Adler (1994), Graham (2006). xx Doxastic defeaters will be beliefs already held by the recipient that show the testimony to be untrustworthy, or which render P extremely improbable on her evidence. xxi Versions of K‐SuFF are advocated by Audi (1997), Adler (2002), Coady (1992), McDowell (1994), Owens (2000),Welbourne (1986). xxii That is to say, her T‐environment is such that she might easily receive testimony that is false, but for which she possesses no doxastic defeaters, and which is such that her T‐method would fail to screen it out as untrustworthy. xxiii lackey (2008) ch. 2.4 argues against K‐SuFF. Her focus is on the fact that K‐SuFF does not require doxastic responsibility/rationality of the testimony recipient, rather than on the lack of any provision to ensure modal reliability. 116 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y xxiv True testimonial belief generated via a suitably veritistic T‐method will certainly fail to satisfy Reliability when the subject is in a one‐off unusual T‐environment that is anoma­ lously unfavorable, but may do so more generally since suitable veritism only requires a high percentage of beliefs produced to be true, not all of them. Conversely, in an anomalously favorable environment a belief may satisfy Reliability despite not being generated by a suitably veritistic process. xxv See burge (1993), Coady (1992), Welbourne (1986). xxvi Doxastic defeaters for an instance of testimony are other beliefs possessed by the subject which are counter‐evidence to the truth of the testimony. Possible defeaters for a given instance of testimony include: evidence that the speaker is likely to be lying, or mistaken – e.g., a bad track‐ record; strong counter‐evidence to what she states, including contrary reliable testimony. xxvii A similar rift between justified true belief and knowledge opens up for similar reasons, if a modal reliability condition for perceptual knowledge is combined with a similar account of justified perceptual belief. xxviii Goldberg (2010) maintains that by putting the effective filter at a subdoxastic level a form of anti‐reductionism is maintained. I don’t wish to debate the applicability of such labels here. The “bottom line” is: reliability in the process of forming belief through acceptance of testimony must be maintained in part by an effective filter at the recipient’s end. xxix Flukes apart, someone’s testimony is true just if they are both sincere (express their own belief in their statement), and the belief they express is true. The empirical literature focuses on detection of lying, rather than of honest error, and therefore I do so for much of this discussion. xxx I am not trained as a social scientist, fully to critique the soundness of experimental meth­ odology and validity and robustness of results. A full evaluation will need to do this. xxxi I insert this caveat because it is of course extremely difficult in an experimental situation to recreate the real situation of a true lie – someone who is deceiving with bad faith, for her own gain, due to her own motives, and with attendant fear of discovery and feelings of guilt. College students being paid to misdescribe their feelings about what they are seeing on a film is a good attempt, but falls short of the real thing. See ekman, P. and M. O’Sullivan (1991). xxxii See also Michaelian (2009). Michaelian takes the empirical literature to have established that speaker “monitoring” for truthfulness is ineffective. He points out that ineffective monitoring for deceptiveness, and undiscriminating acceptance, serve equally badly as T‐ methods in a T‐environment that offers a high proportion of (ex hypothesi undetected) liars, but also equally well in one offering very few liars. However he does not address the issue of the limited “ecological validity” of the empirical studies which has been my focus here; in particular the fact that a situation in which screening for lying is confined to perceptual cues as its basis is not a T‐recipient’s normal situation. xxxiii I am of course not advocating a general program of compulsory epistemic retraining, or other unacceptable forms of social engineering. but first, information may move people; second, for specific professionals it may be acceptable to require training in appropriate epistemic practices; third, education already involves some teaching of how to be critical of sources, thinking about possible bias, angles and so forth. More of this could empower cit­ izens by enabling them to seek information more effectively from available sources – which websites to trust, how to detect bad information, and so forth. A different topic from to­ day’s; but one suggested by it. xxxiv See Dawes (1994), and also the discussion and studies cited in Kornblith (2002). xxxv Suspending judgment in a case of possible lying would not directly yield a true belief, of course; but it could ensure the subject had an effective filter, and so enable other instances where she accepts testimony to qualify as knowledge. u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y 117 xxxvi I take justification to be a necessary condition for knowledge; if one’s favored reliability condition does not ensure this, then it is a further necessary condition. xxxvii See Fricker (1994), Graham (2006). xxxviii See the discussion of related matters in Goldman (1999) ch. 4. xxxix Goldberg (2008) suggests that to give a plausible account of how young children are able to get knowledge from testimony despite being unable to filter effectively, we need to theorize their T‐method as including their carers who in effect, as he maintains, serve as Guardian Angels. Goldberg (2010) goes further, proposing a more radical externalism in the individ­ uation of testimony as a belief‐forming process, to include the testifier as part of a single “broad” cognitive process. Goldberg here echoes the strategy of burge (1993), treating testimony as metaphysically and epistemically analogous to memory – a single “rational source for reason” within the cognitive economy of a rational subject. It is beyond the agenda of the present discussion to tackle this proposal, but I am as yet unconvinced. xl Compare the case when Maud says only “I stayed late at the office,” letting Cyril think she was working, when in fact she and lover were together there. Fricker (2012) explores the respects in which misleading someone by means of conversational implicature differs from explicit lying. xli Assuming, that is, we do not do anything fancy with our individuation of methods to preclude the negative result. See below. xlii Note that this is not a lackey‐case, viz. of a reliable testifier who nonetheless lacks knowledge. See lackey (2008) ch. 2.3. xliii lackey (2008) ch. 5 contains several examples, each one of which is structurally similar to one of those given here. Her discussion is focused mainly on issues of doxastic respon­ sibility, and she does not explicitly formulate actual‐world modal reliability as a matter at issue. Her proposed necessary condition for the gaining of knowledge through testimony, that “the environment in which b receives A’s testimony is suitable for the reception of testimony” is aimed at ensuring modal reliability, being aimed at ruling out Case‐Three situations. Thus it is, by the lights of our present proposal, too strong. xliv Harman’s classic example, in which a tourist in a totalitarian‐regime country by chance reads the only reliable newspaper, began this genre. See Harman (1973). xlv Goldman (1992) makes a very similar proposal about epistemic justification. However, it seems he still holds to the straight modal reliability condition as necessary for knowledge, that is here questioned. (Goldman, verbal comment, bled, Slovenia June 2013). xlvi It may be commented at this point that I have made a suggestion about the basis and shape of our everyday attributions of knowledge, what our folk concept entails, rather than about the features that are in fact crucial for knowledge. So be it. Delicate and key methodologi­ cal issues arise here, which I cannot now address. Goldman (1992) makes important use of a distinction between folk‐attributions of knowledge, and correct attributions. xlvii Given what is said above about the unstable context‐sensitivity of intuitions about knowledge, the status of such a theory would be explicative, rather than a strict analysis of our folk concept. See Kornblith (2002) for an interesting novel take on the nature of a proper philosophical account of knowledge, and the role intuition plays in developing it xlviii Goldberg (2010) supports the idea of some such condition on justified acceptance of testimony. lackey maintains that “in order to acquire knowledge from…testimony… the hearer…has to be a properly functioning or reliable recipient of testimony, where… being appropriately sensitive to defeaters [is] [a] central component of this…requirement” (lackey 2008: 163). xlix One could acquire a true belief via a deviant causal chain, such as those discussed in the 1970s literature on the causal theory of perception, while not instantiating a normal method. See Peacocke (1979). 118 u NR el IA ble T e STIMON y l There would also be a failure of reliability, of course, if rather than being accurately preserved once laid down, memories were corrupted or interfered with. I understand empirical work on memory reveals this kind of process. This is not my present topic, and I stick with my toy two‐stage model. li Just as I abstract from the possibility of corruption of laid‐down memories over time, so I here abstract from the scope for the link of testimony to fail due to misunderstanding by the recipient of what the speaker states. Testimony as a link has perfect conditional reliability – it yields only true outputs from true inputs, indeed the very same one, so long as there is no failure of understanding. lii As conveyed in personal conversation with Shieber, in symposium at the APA in Chicago, February 2010. liii earlier versions of parts of this paper were presented at a conference on Testimony in the Philosophy Department at Nottingham university in May 2012; in the Philosophy Department at bristol university in October 2012; and at a Social epistemology conference in bled, Slovenia in May 2013; as well as at graduate seminars in Oxford.

Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. elizabeth Fricker’s chapter, “unreliable Testimony,” is a wonderful piece of work, an excellent complement to her groundbreaking essays on testimony in the 1980s and 1990s (Fricker 1987, 1994, 1995), which propelled widespread interest in the topic and made it a corner­ stone of the emerging field of social epistemology. My chief criticism of this essay is that it’s too full of intriguing ideas. It’s impossible to do it justice within the paltry 1000‐word limit to which my replies are confined. I shall therefore concentrate on a single element of the chapter, which is relevant not only to testimony but to knowledge in general. Fricker offers an account of testimonial knowledge that is clearly within the reliabilist tradition, although her final formulation is, as she puts it, is a rather “novel” version of relia­ bilism. Her point of departure is to require a knower to satisfy a reliability condition, which includes both the use of a generally reliable process and a modal “no relevant alternatives” proviso. Her “second formulation” of this dual reliability requirement runs as follows: Reliability: A person who forms a certain belief b by means of a method M … satisfies Reliability with respect to b just if b is true, and it is not the case that she might easily have formed a relevantly similar belief b’ by means of M which was false. She then adapts this reliability condition to testimony. The crucial new ingredient she introduces is the helpful notion of a (testimonial) “filter” that can lead a receiver of testimony to avoid believing falsehoods. She formulates an “effective filter” condition for testimonially reliable knowledge that reads as follows: [A person] A’s T‐method includes a filter that would detect and block belief in all the instances of false testimony that she might easily encounter; so that she is disposed to believe only the true, knowledge‐expressing instances among the testimonies she might easily encounter. reply to Fricker 122 R e P l y T O   FRICK e R A major question on Fricker’s agenda is whether this reliability constraint on testimonial knowledge is universally correct. Appealing to some nuanced examples, she eventually concludes “no,” thereby breaking with the “standard” reliabilist story. Next, however, she advances an approach that maintains the “spirit” of reliabilism though not its letter. Her novel approach rests heavily on an idea she calls “approved‐list reliabilism.” The idea here was first presented in my “epistemic folkways and scientific epistemology” (Goldman 1992) as part of a theory of justification rather than knowledge. Fricker applies it to (testimonial) knowledge. I had originally labeled the idea “two‐stage reliabilism,” but I immediately adopted her more evocative phrase as soon as I encountered it. It is presented as an approach that can explain why attributors make or withhold certain justi­ fication or knowledge ascriptions that seem hard to explain under the original forms of (process) reliabilism. My presentation focused on two different “stages” of justification attribution. First, an attributor acquires beliefs about which processes are reliable and which unreliable in the actual world, and constructs a list of those epistemically “good” and “bad” processes. When asked to decide whether a certain hypothetical belief is justified or unjustified, she consults her list and decides whether the implied belief‐forming process is on her good list or bad list – her “approved list” or her “disapproved list.” even if the hypothetical case specifies a different reliability tendency in, for example, some merely possible world, the attributor is still guided by his/her list (based on what is found in the actual world). In bonJour’s clairvoyance example, Norman is described as having a perfectly reliable clairvoyance capacity. Nonetheless, people are inclined to judge his clairvoyance beliefs “unjustified.” Why? According to approved‐list reliabilism (AlR), this is because attributors either have clairvoyance on their “bad” mental list or because it resembles other processes on their disapproved list (for example, mental telepathy or extra‐sensory perception). That’s how they arrive at the negative attribution, “unjusti­ fied.” Similarly for the new evil demon case. Since many kinds of perception are reliable in the actual world, we all have perception on our approved list. Then, when assessing the justifiedness of a perception‐based belief in the demon world, where people are stipulated to lack perceptual reliability, we nonetheless consult our list and find it tempting to classify these aliens as possessors of (perception‐based) knowledge. This was my original purpose in introducing what Fricker now labels “approved list reliabilism.” Of course, her chief motivation is to explain knowledge attributions in testi­ monial cases. but that is certainly a legitimate type of example, and I am well‐disposed toward using the AlR approach in this domain. Of course, attributivism of the kind represented by AlR may not find favor among straight‐laced “factualists” within epistemology. They will insist on being told the “facts” about what is necessary and sufficient for justification or knowledge, not some story that might explain why speakers make or withhold epistemic attributions. but across a large swath of philosophy, practitioners are finding compelling reasons to turn to analytical techniques that abandon purely semantical or factualist analyses in favor of pragmatics‐ infused approaches, which offer explanations in terms of speaker or attributor properties. The latter approaches include varieties of assessment relativism (MacFarlane 2005), contextualism (DeRose 2009), credal expressivism (yalcin 2011), and so forth. AlR should be seen, broadly speaking, as belonging in this (quite respectable) camp. R e P l y T O   FRICK e R 123 References DeRose, K. (2009) The Case for Contextualism, 1. Clarendon Press, Oxford.

Process Reliabilism and Virtue Epistemologyi E R n E st s osa 6 1 Bipartisan Epistemology Our main topic is Alvin Goldman’s recent attempt to combine elements of evidentialism with his own process reliabilism. After subjecting evidentialism to a detailed critique, he argues that a correct epistemology will need to combine factors of two sorts in explaining how our beliefs acquire epistemic justification. He proposes a “two‐factor theory” that makes room both for truth‐reliability and also for the important bearing of evidence. For several decades now two broad parties have debated central issues of epistemology. Reliabilists seek to explain epistemic normativity through truth‐aimed reliability. Evidentialists, by contrast, take justification to involve not mere reliability, but rather “fitting the subject’s evidence.” They define a “well‐founded” (token) belief as one related to the believer’s total evidence so that it (a) fits that evidence, and (b) is held on that basis. Reliabilism is a broad category that includes causal, tracking, process, and virtue varie- ties. In this broad sense, even Descartes is clearly a reliabilist. In the second paragraph of his Third Meditation, for example, he wonders what accounts for the certainty of sum res cogitans. In his view, it is clarity and distinctness that does so, but it could do so, he adds immediately, only if nothing could ever be so clear and distinct without being true. What follows will focus on process reliabilism specifically, given that here I mean to honor our honoree, but it will inevitably involve virtue reliabilism as well. Both of these varieties, as they appear on the contemporary scene, are explicitly externalist. Evidentialism too has varieties. It is a broadly internalist epistemology. But this comes in two sorts. According to access internalism, a factor could not make a belief justified simply through its efficacy in rendering that belief probably true, if the subject lacks access to that factor 128 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y (or, according to a stronger form of the view, even to its efficacy). Moreover, this access must be of a special sort; it must be access through armchair reflection. For mentalism, the factors on which the justification of a belief supervenes must satisfy a different condition. Rather than being relevantly accessible to the subject, they must all be among his mental states. There could not possibly be mental twins that diverged epis- temically so that one but not the other was justified in a certain shared belief. This applies both to propositional and also to doxastic justification, both to the justification that one can have for believing even if one does not already believe, and also to the justification that one has in (justifiedly) believing as one (already) does. What follows will explore the possibilities for rapprochement between reliabilism and evidentialism. Two main proposals are on offer. One is Goldman’s “Toward a synthesis of reliabilism and evidentialism? Or: evidentialism’s troubles, reliabilism’s rescue package” (2011). The other is “Evidentialist reliabilism,” by Juan comesaña (2010). I will argue that the prospects for any such rapprochement between reliabilism and evidentialism are dim, and that the appearance to the contrary is mostly an illusion. I will also draw on a paper by Jack lyons, “Perception and virtue reliabilism,” (2009) so as to focus on the prospects for rapprochement through virtue reliabilism more specifically. Here in the end I find a more hopeful basis for compromise. We begin with a critical examination of Goldman’s initiative. 1.1 Goldman’s way Goldman’s paper stops short of a full bipartisan theory of epistemic justification. The paper distinguishes two varieties of justification, the inferential and the experiential. Inferential justification is said to involve two sorts of factors, neither of which is negligi- ble. When a belief is inferentially justified, its content must “fit” the believer’s evidence. That is the evidentialist factor. But the belief must also derive from a reliable enough process that connects the subject’s evidence with the truth of the content believed. It will not do to just guess, no matter how well the content of the guess may fit the subject’s total evidence. Epistemic justification requires more than just the relevant luck of a believer who is not motivated rationally to believe as he does by the adequate evidence in his pos- session. He has evidence that propositionally justifies him to believe as he does but he does not believe on the basis of that evidence. The paper includes a subtle and detailed critique of evidentialism. ii The positive contribu- tion of the paper is divided into two parts. First we are offered a way to think of “inferential” justification, and next we are offered a way to understand “experiential” justification. 1.1.1 Inferential justification Inferential justification is said to derive from doxastic evidence, which is constituted at a time by all the justified beliefs held by the subject at that time. But here we hit a snag. P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 129 suppose we want to explain what makes a subject inferentially justified in believing that p at t. Included among his beliefs is his belief that p itself. If justified, this belief forms part of our subject’s doxastic evidence, which comprises all of his justified beliefs at the time. unfortunately, the target proposition, the proposition that p, will then trivially “fit” the subject’s doxastic evidence, which can hardly help to explain how and why that belief is justified. About inferential justification, we are given, not an actual proposal of necessary and sufficient conditions, but only the suggestion that any correct account will need to make room both for an evidentialist, “fitting the evidence,” component, and for a reliable process component. A problem arises for this programmatic idea, however, because the evidence that must be fit is the doxastic evidence in the subject’s possession at the time, which is said to be the totality of his justified beliefs at that time. This is what leads to trouble when we wish to explain how a subject’s doxastic justification for a given belief arises. The trouble is that the subject’s belief could hardly fail to fit his doxastic evidence, since it must then itself figure in that body of evidence, which trivializes the “fitting the evidence” requirement. suppose, moreover, that the belief were not justified. Obviously, it would then fail to fit the total evidence. Of course the total evidence could make that belief justified only if it was indeed justified, in which case it would itself be part of the total doxastic evi- dence. Take any total doxastic evidence from which that belief is missing, because the subject holds it without justification. (We must assume that the subject does hold the belief, since the justification we are now considering is doxastic. It is justification that applies to token, existing beliefs.) suppose the belief in question were missing from the subject’s doxastic evidence. That would require that it be held but unjustified. Remember: it would have to be included in the doxastic evidence if it were justified. Trivially, then, if a subject’s token belief is missing from his doxastic evidence, it has to be unjustified. On the view of doxastic justification before us, then, a token belief will be doxasti- cally justified if and only if it is itself included in the subject’s doxastic evidence. This biconditional is assured simply and directly by the definition of doxastic evidence. We therefore need a better conception of the (relevant) doxastic evidence in a subject’s pos- session at a time t. We need a conception on which it will not be definitionally trivial that the subject’s belief is doxastically justified if and only if it fits his (relevant) doxastic evidence.iii We could of course move to a notion of inferential justification relative to certain beliefs. If a belief is to be inferentially justified by inference from certain other beliefs, these other beliefs must themselves be justified. so, we could now define a belief ’s being inferentially justified as its being justified relative to certain other beliefs held by the subject, where it will be part of the definition that these other beliefs must themselves be justified. Perhaps this will suffice for Goldman’s theoretical purposes in this paper. He could now supple- ment this proposal with some two‐factor provisos, and the package would be safe from the trivialization objection. 130 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 1.1.2 Experiential justification so far we have considered inferential justification. next we turn to experiential justifica- tion. Here now is the gist of the proposed account (and I quote): a) How could a doxastic attitude toward a proposition “fit” an experiential state, assuming that both have content (whether the same or different kinds of content)? In the case of inferential fittingness, we proposed that the relevant relation is that the truth of the contents of the premises should make probable the truth of the content of the conclusion. Perhaps the same idea can work here. Perhaps we can say that a belief in proposition p fits the evidence provided by experiential state E just in case the truth of the content of E makes (highly) probable the truth of p. (Goldman 2011: sect. 7, para. 11) b) I propose, then, in parallel with the [earlier] proposal [re inferential justification], that experiential justifiedness is a function of two factors, or components. One factor says that belief in a proposition is prima facie justified in experiential terms only if the belief fits with the subject’s current experiential evidence. The second factor says that an experience‐based belief is justified only if it is the product of a reliable experience‐based process. The two‐factor theory says that an experiential belief is fully justified (doxastic considerations aside) only if it is justified in terms of both factors. This two‐factor approach to experience‐based justifiedness, which  marries the requirement of evidential fittingness with production by a reliable process, has significant attractions, I have argued. (Goldman 2011: sect. 7, para. 18) 1.1.3 How do these proposals bear on the objections faced in recent years by process reliabilism? As they stand their bearing is uncertain. True, we have been given some general advice for how to construct an account of inferential justification. We have also been offered a necessary condition for experiential justification. This is a two‐factor condition, one that includes both a reliabilist and an evidentialist component. But it is proposed only as a necessary condition. no set of necessary and sufficient conditions is in evidence either for propositional or for doxastic justification. The two necessary conditions offered – one for experiential, one for inferential justification – never come together into any overall account of epistemic justification. nor can we yet derive any necessary condition for epistemic justification, since neither experiential justification nor inferential justification is necessary for epistemic justification. Perhaps it will be pro- posed that the disjunction of these two is necessary for epistemic justification. But that has not yet been proposed, and it remains to be seen how well that would fare. One might think, to the contrary, that basic a priori justification is neither experiential nor inferential. so, it remains to be seen what will be proposed as necessary for epistemic justification in keeping with the two‐factor view; a fortiori, we have yet to see a two‐factor set of conditions proposed as sufficient and necessary for epistemic justification. P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 131 1.1.4 Necessary conditions and the demands of bipartisanship We are offered a positive suggestion concerning the proposed necessary conditions for experiential and for inferential justification. We are told how these conditions might bear on at least one of the major problems for process reliabilism. This will work only on an assumption peripheral to the main positive account, but Goldman seems clearly enough sympathetic to that assumption. This emerges in Juan comesaña’s recent attempt at bipartisanship, and what Goldman has to say about it, as follows: As indicated at the outset, one aim of this paper [Goldman’s] is to explore the prospects for a hybrid theory of justification that combines the strengths of reliabilism and evidentialism. Thus far, however, rather limited steps have been taken toward embracing evidentialist themes. The main such step … was to advocate a two‐factor theory of inferential justifica- tion, in which one factor is a belief ’s fittingness relation to the subject’s doxastic evidence. should reliabilism go a step further and acknowledge an analogous role for fittingness with nondoxastic evidence, for cases of non‐inferential justification? This is what comesaña recommends in his proposed synthesis. He motivates this move in response to the oft‐cited counterexamples to reliabilism offered by BonJour (1985) and lehrer (1990). The examples of norman the clairvoyant (BonJour) and Mr. Truetemp (lehrer) purport to demonstrate the non‐sufficiency of reliability for justifiedness. comesaña’s diagnosis of these cases is that the subject lacks any evidence – especially experiential evidence – on which his belief is based. nonetheless, the beliefs in these cases are all reliably caused. so reliabilism must classify them as justified  –  a mistaken classification according to most commentators. comesaña therefore proposes a strengthened sufficiency condition according to which a belief is justified if it is caused by a reliable process that includes some evidence. We earlier acknowledged a need for doxastic evidence in the case of inferential justification. Why not join comesaña in taking the further step of requiring nondoxastic evidence, i.e., experien- tial evidence, for non‐inferential justifiedness? This would handle the clairvoyance and Truetemp cases and would add more heft to the proposed synthesis of reliabilism and evidentialism. (Goldman 2011: sect. 7, para 1) Here for us is the crucial question posed by Goldman: “Why not join comesaña in taking the further step of requiring nondoxastic evidence, i.e., experiential evidence, for non‐inferential justifiedness?” If the question is rhetorical, and Goldman is assum- ing that non‐inferential justification must be experiential, with a requirement of experiential evidence, then we do have a clear bearing on the clairvoyant and Truetemp examples. Whether this is Goldman’s position is in some doubt, however, given his comments on Jack lyons, who rejects the following Grounds Principle: Grounds Principle: every justified belief must have some justifying ground, or reason. By ‘ground’ or ‘reason’ (and I’ll use these interchangeably), I mean something on which the agent bases her belief. The Grounds Principle is a broadly evidentialist principle: it holds that a justified belief has to have some kind of evidential basis, with the ground of the belief providing that evidence. (lyons 2009: 250) 132 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y For our purposes the main outcome is that Goldman does not definitely side with comesaña against lyons on whether non‐inferential justification requires a rational basis in grounds or evidence. Despite the clear opportunity to do so, he refrains from taking sides. He just presents the opposing views of both comesaña and lyons, and restricts himself to noncommittal sideline commentary. nonetheless, it is doubtful that Goldman really means to leave that issue open so wide. What would be left of bipartisanship if one agreed with lyons that evidence is not required for epistemic justification, not even for the epistemic justification of simple beliefs about our surroundings? A bipartisan offer could not possibly reject outright the central plank of the opposing party. And comesaña ostensibly enables us to accommodate such a non‐negotiable commitment of evidentialism. so, I will assume that on the current issue Goldman does want (and need) to cast his lot with comesaña, and against lyons. Accordingly, next I’d like to take up comesaña’s proposed bipartisan position. I do so in part on the assumption that the position proposed is of a sort that Goldman would endorse. I assume he would endorse not only the bipartisan intent, but also the strategy employed. If this strategy is rejected, and if one goes so far as to join lyons’s side, then bipartisanship fails. Foreclosing the comesaña strategy would therefore highlight the need for some alternative on pain of failure for the overall project.iv 1.2 comesaña’s way Here the objective is exactly the same as Goldman’s: namely, to strengthen reliabilism with a mix of evidentialism, and strengthen evidentialism with a mix of reliabilism. The aim is to develop a bipartisan position that includes elements of each side. What is that position? The concluding passage of the paper gives the gist: [To] be justified in the only epistemologically important sense is to believe in accordance with one’s evidence, and one’s beliefs accord with one’s evidence if and only if that evidence is reliably connected to the truth of those beliefs. (comesaña 2010: concluding para.) How does this generate the desired solution for the clairvoyance and Truetemp problems, the solution that seemingly persuades Goldman? Here is how comesaña phrases it: If the problem that BonJour identified with reliabilism has to do with its failure to account for the dependency of justification on evidence, then the following revision of indexical reliabilism fixes that problem: Proto‐evidentialist reliabilism: s’s belief that p is justified if and only if that belief was produced by a process P which includes some evidence e and: i. e doesn’t include any beliefs of s and P is actually reliable; or ii. e includes beliefs of s, all of these beliefs are justified, and P is conditionally actually reliable. P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 133 Proto‐evidentialist reliabilism has the consequence that norman’s belief is not justified, because it was produced by a process that doesn’t include any evidence. (comesaña 2010: 583) The solution seems to be, then, that clairvoyant norman and Mr. Truetemp fall short of epistemic justification because they fall short of Goldman’s experiential justification. neither of them has any sensory experiential basis for believing as he does. In order to evaluate this solution, it would be best to see it laid out in full generality. Here now is how comesaña sums up his view: Evidentialist Reliabilism: A belief that p by s is justified if and only if: i. there is a field of propositions F to which p belongs; ii. s has evidence e; iii. the belief that p by s is based on e; and either a) e doesn’t include any beliefs and the type producing a belief that q (where q is in F) based on evidence e is actually reliable; or b) e includes other beliefs of s, all of those beliefs are justified and the type producing a belief that q (where q is in F) based on evidence e is conditionally actually reliable. (589) v Doubts about the view emerge, however, when we consider how it is meant to deal with innate and intuitive knowledge. Here first is the proposal about innate knowledge: s has innate knowledge that p if and only if s has the innate capacity to understand p, and understanding p is sufficient for knowing p. under that conception of innate knowledge, it is easy to specify the mental state that constitutes the evidence which justifies s in believing that p: it is the fact that s understands that p. (587) Mentalist evidence includes mental states, on the basis of which a subject might appropri- ately believe a proposition that fits those states. so, the “fact” of s’s understanding that p is to be understood accordingly, so that it is (or corresponds to) the (possibly dispositional) mental state of s’s understanding the proposition that p. This is a crucial move, the move of including the state of understanding that p (or the corresponding fact: that the subject understands that p) in the evidence available to a subject for believing that p. What makes this move so useful is that we can now account for how a subject can be justified through intuition (or, alternatively, innately) with no need for more normal experiential evidence (of, for example, the sensory variety). We can now say that a subject might believe very simple, basic a priori truths of arith- metic, geometry, or logic based simply on his understanding of the relevant propositions. And if we are as flexible with the word “evidence” as is comesaña, we can even say that the subject has thereby an evidential basis for so believing. But wait. How can a subject be epistemically justified in believing elementary a priori propositions simply on the basis of understanding them, if there are plenty of things he understands just as well with no possibility of believing them justifiably based just on 134 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y understanding them? The difference is that over some domains  –  such as elementary arithmetic, geometry, and logic – the subject has a competence to discern the true from the false with no need for any further basis, such as a sensory basis, beyond simply his understanding the propositions in question. It is this competence that accounts for his being justified in believing as he does even on so paltry a basis. How widely must the competence be shared in order to do its good work for any indi- vidual subject? Here is the relevant clause in comesaña’s account (quoted above in full): iii. the belief that p by s is based on e; and … (a) e doesn’t include any beliefs and the type producing a belief that q (where q is in F) based on evidence e is actually reliable [where F picks out the relevant domain, one in which believing based on e is said to be reliable, such as, say, simple arithmetic, geometry, or logic] It is the satisfaction of this clause that will explain how it is that the innate knower and the intuitive knower will be justified with no sensory basis, nor indeed any basis other than the sheer understanding of what they believe. note however, the item that the view requires must be reliable. It is a type: the type producing a belief that q [where q is in F] based on evidence e. And this type makes no essential reference to the particular subject s. so, for s to be able to derive epistemic justification from basing his belief on the sheer understanding of its content (or on whatever he bases it on), such basing must be sufficiently reliable when we consider it over the span of all its occurrences. It does not matter who is doing the basing. It is required that the type defined by such basing be reliable even when it is someone else who is doing the basing. And now we have a dilemma for the view. Given how often inept beliefs are based on sheer understanding, vi the reliability requirement imposed would preclude our having epistemic justification derived from our basing of beliefs on our understanding of the relevant domain of truths, no matter how competent our own basing might be. We might plausibly respond by relativizing. We might just focus on normal human epistemic justifi- cation, and ignore the (possibly numerous) believers who might incompetently form their beliefs based on sheer understanding. so long as for normal humans generally such basing is reliable enough, beliefs so based get to be humanly justified thereby.vii One problem for such relativizing to humanity at large is that it will leave unexplained how it is that Ramanujans, and idiot‐savants, are justified. clearly they do not have human justification. Presumably we will need to introduce forms of justification other than the overall human one. One might introduce a relativizing parameter and then try to specify the type of justification of interest in a given context, or perhaps contextual factors would do the job for us. While less than ideal, this may perhaps be tolerable as a solution available under the present approach. It is not immediately clear, however, how it is that a belief might be based just on understanding. The relevant basing in epistemology is rational basing, the basing of a belief on a reason that motivates that belief, or on reasons that do so (and similarly for other epistemically relevant attitudes). Of course, a belief might have a good rational basis even if it does not have one at that same time slice. Take a belief retained in memory even P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 135 after its original formative basis has faded from memory. This belief can still be relevantly based on good reasons, even if those reasons are no longer operative. It can be based on reasons through the channel of memory. Many beliefs are culturally or evolutionarily acquired, however; they are not acquired through any ratiocination, as Wittgenstein emphasizes in On Certainty. Many beliefs about language and grammar are absorbed as one learns one’s mother tongue, again sans ratiocination. unfortunately, not all that is acquired thus is properly acquired. superstition and unfounded prejudice can also enter the child’s mind that way. such beliefs are rationally motivated by nothing beyond understanding, no matter how far back we go. They are not acquired through ratiocination. This puts in doubt that being based just on understanding is sufficient to render a belief epistemically justified. Put another way, what is put in doubt is this: that a belief would be epistemically justified simply in virtue of being motivation- ally based on no reason(s) other than just the understanding of its content by the believer. (The mere inclusion of understanding seems of course trivial, since no proposition could be believed without being understood.) nor can we clearly solve the problem by delimiting a relevant field of propositions just through their content. For one thing, superstition and bias would seem to be possible within the realms of epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics where we would want to be able to acquire intuitively justified beliefs a priori and foundationally. Moreover, there is nothing to preclude inappropriate culturally imbibed beliefs with geometric and arith- metical subject matter. A malign enough culture could surely poison its young with such beliefs, through efficient mechanisms of enculturation. consider then beliefs acquired just on the basis of understanding, no matter how far back we go, at least as concerns ratiocination, or rational motivation. I conclude that among such beliefs we must distinguish the epistemically appropriate from those that fall short. Mechanisms that instill belief with no benefit of rational basing must be divided into the properly efficient and the poisonous. I mean here an epistemic division. some such beliefs are justified, or competent, whereas others are just biases or superstitions. This division cannot be made, surely, independently of what will and what will not reliably deliver truth. 1.3 conclusion on the prospects for bipartisan compromise comesaña and Goldman attempt to give something to each party so as to secure a com- promise acceptable to both. But we have seen how dim the prospects are for any such compromise. To reiterate, the main stumbling block for the comesaña/Goldman project turns on what lyons calls the Grounds Principle: Grounds Principle: every justified belief must have some justifying ground, or reason. By ‘ground’ or ‘reason’ (and I’ll use these interchangeably), I mean something on which the agent bases her belief. The Grounds Principle is a broadly evidentialist principle: it holds that a justified belief has to have some kind of evidential basis, with the ground of the belief providing that evidence. (lyons 2009: 250) 136 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y The requirement of such grounds runs against the problem of knowledge that is ostensibly groundless. A belief constitutive of such knowledge has presumably the epistemic standing required, beyond being a true belief, for amounting to knowledge. But it is plausible that simple a priori beliefs can be thus “justified” groundlessly. viii One might try to detach justification from knowledge, but this project is doomed. It  might make some headway against examples of blindsight or of clairvoyance, but it crashes on the fact that simple truths of arithmetic, geometry, and logic can be accessed through justified seemings or beliefs ostensibly based on no grounds. Against this, comesaña proposes that the evidentialist can appeal to a mental state after all, that of understanding, which could even be a state of occurrently grasping or entertaining. It is this that provides the kind of reason or grounds that enables us to concede that one must always have some evidence (reason, ground) if one is to be epistemically justified. But this does not give evidentialists what they need. Of course no‐one can be justified in believing, nor can they know, what they do not understand. so, understanding will always be a required basis for any belief that is justified and constitutes knowledge. But this is a trivial fact with little if any epistemic import. Every belief must involve such understanding. you cannot believe what you do not under- stand. you cannot judge what you do not grasp. This applies to all unjustified ignorance just as much as to all knowledge and justified belief. something further must therefore distinguish the knowledge and justified belief of the child who has learned much simple logic, arithmetic, and geometry, from the ignorant beliefs of the superstitious or bigoted among us. Believers of both sorts have formed many of their relevant beliefs with no benefit of ratiocination. But only the former are thereby justified and attain knowledge. What is the difference? clearly it is not to be found in any basis provided by the mere understanding of what they believe, nor on the fact that they have no other rational basis, no matter how far back we go. For, they are the same in all of those respects. One plausible difference is that the beliefs of the well‐taught child are competent – competently formed and sustained—through an epistemic competence constituted by reliable enough deliverance of truth. Moreover, we now face a dilemma as follows. compare the norman and Truetemp cases. The advantage that evidentialism was supposed to bring to the bipartisan table was the ability to account for our intuitions on such cases. But if we are flexible with under- standing in the way suggested, then evidentialism will be unable to keep its side of the bargain. After all, norman and Truetemp believe as they do “based” on the “evidence” provided by their understanding just as much as the innate and intuitive knower. And, by hypothesis, they also believe reliably. so don’t we have the undesired consequence that they are after all epistemically justified in believing as they do? Once we see how problematic the concession to evidentialists turns out to be, slim hope remains that it will so much as bring them to the bargaining table. At every level, in every relevant way, we are reserving the place of honor and consequence for competence, for reliability. The place of evidence is either nonexistent or subsidiary and dependent at most. At least so it is in our account both of knowledge and of the sort of doxastic justifica- tion that is relevant to knowledge. Once we allow mere understanding as a form of evidence, finally, we lose a main benefit that evidentialism was supposed to provide: namely, the P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 137 ability to explain why knowledge is denied to norman the clairvoyant, to Mr. Truetemp, and to other subjects supposedly deprived of relevant evidence. Once understanding is allowed as evidence, no‐one is deprived – indeed no believer could possibly be deprived – of such evidence. so, the knowledge of anyone who has no other evidence, will be determined simply by how reliably they believe. Again, this seems an outright capitulation of eviden- tialism to reliabilism. compatibly with all of that, one can of course choose to focus on a study of evidence and of how evidence leads to justification. Both reliabilists and evidentialists can happily collaborate in such study. It is obviously important and interesting. Regarding this, once again, agreement is easy, and there has never been any disagreement, nor should there ever have been any. This is not the locus of any real disagreement, nor of any real bipartisan compromise. My own preferred compromise between internalism and externalism focuses mainly not on mentalist but on access internalism, and involves a distinction between animal and reflective epistemic levels. let us next explore this approach. 2 Process Reliabilism Compared with Virtue Epistemology According to process reliabilism, the epistemic justification of a belief derives from the reliability of the causal process that produces it. What follows will take up two problems for that view, one familiar, the other new (to my knowledge). And we will then turn to an alternative framework within which a resolution for these problems will be sought. 2.1 The first, known, problem The known problem is posed by a token belief produced through a reliable enough process at a time t when the believer is also in one or more of the following situations: B1. He believes that his belief B is unreliable, or unjustified. call this proposition u(B). B2. He believes u(B) justifiably (justifiedly), all things considered, at t. B3. consider the totality of reasons available to the believer at t in order to determine whether u(B). The balance of these strongly favors believing u(B). This is so whether the believer actually does believe u(B) or not. Each of these puts in doubt the claim that the believer is epistemically justified in holding belief B at t.ix As main developer and advocate of process reliabilism, Goldman has long defended a particular sort of defense against that line of objection. Here follows a statement of that defense: An attractive way to bolster reliabilism is to add a weaker supplementary condition, a negative higher‐order condition. Goldman proposed such a condition in Epistemology and Cognition 138 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y (1986: 111–112) in the form of a non‐undermining (or “anti‐defeater”) condition. This says that a cognizer, to be justified, must not have reason to believe that her first‐order belief isn’t reliably caused. This promises to handle the clairvoyance and Truetemp cases very smoothly. surely Truetemp, like the rest of us, has reason to think that beliefs that come out of the blue – as far as one can tell introspectively – are unreliably caused. Hence he has reason to believe that his spontaneous beliefs about the precise ambient temperature are unreliably caused. so his first‐order beliefs about the ambient temperature violate the supplementary condition, and therefore are unjustified. This makes contact with problem B3 above. In effect, it says that belief B is justified only if B3 is false. so it simply adds the denial of B3 as a further condition for B’s being epis- temically justified, in addition to its being produced by a reliable process. However, as Goldman recognizes, a true process reliabilist must go beyond the present formulation of the required condition. After all, this formulation is in the epistemically normative terms that process reliabilism would like to define. Process reliabilism is at least supposed to provide a supervenience base for the holding of such conditions, a base that will not itself already include normative conditions. The theory is supposed to explain how the norma- tive status of a belief derives from non‐normative conditions. so the theory cannot rest with a proposal that explains the normative status of a belief as one that derives from the absence of certain sorts of “reasons.” This would be to require a normative condition, so the process reliabilist would need to go beyond this to a more pure set of conditions. conditions that can figure properly in the supervenience base must not include normative elements such as a requirement that certain sorts of reasons be present, or be absent. Moreover, the proposed requirement does not address problems B1 and B2. x 2.2 The second, new, problem A further problem emerges when we focus on the fact that judging is of a piece with sus- pending (as is believing with withholding). The epistemic normativity that pertains to conscious judgment cannot be too far different from that which pertains to suspending. sometimes it is right to affirm, sometimes to deny, but sometimes the right thing to do epistemically is to suspend, to forbear both affirming and denying. How then should a process reliabilist think of the epistemology of suspending? Here again there will be some process that eventuates in the subject’s suspending. What truth‐related features of that process will bear on its power to make that token suspending epistemically justified? since truth does not pertain to suspension in the ways it pertains to affirmation and denial, it is not immediately obvious what truth‐related properties of the suspension‐ producing process will bear on the epistemic status of the outcome suspension. suppose our subject has no reason to take his belief B to be unreliably produced. And suppose his belief is in fact reliably produced. He thus satisfies the conditions imposed by Goldman. suppose, however, that: s1. He in fact suspends on whether u(B). s2. It is with excellent epistemic justification that he suspends on whether u(B). P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 139 s3. Regarding the totality of reasons available to the subject at t in order to determine whether u(B), the balance of these (the fact that these are the available reasons, along with their character) strongly favors suspending on u(B). This is so whether the subject actually does suspend on u(B) or not. If B1, B2, and B3 create problems for process reliabilism, then s1, s2, and s3 create similar problems. But the solution proposed by Goldman is not relevant to these problems of suspension. Therefore, that proposed solution will help at most with problem B3. The other five problems seem unaffected. xi The foregoing discussion should also alert us to the limitations of truth‐conducive processes in developing an epistemology that will explain human knowledge, or even epistemic justification. We must make room for an epistemology that covers suspending as well as affirming and denying, one that covers withholding as well as believing and disbelieving. But the concept of the truth‐conducive process falls short in this endeavor. With greater clarity on the nature of suspending we may attain a better position to understand epistemic normativity more generally, not only that of suspending but also that of affirming and denying. 2.3 What, accordingly, is it to suspend on a given question? 1 Is it just consciously neither to believe nor to disbelieve while consciously considering the question? Here are two reasons to doubt that answer. a) That is what one does while one is still deliberating and has not yet decided whether to suspend. b) What if one decides to suspend until further consideration? What about the suspending one does when the question has faded from conscious view? What constitutes one’s suspending at that point, when one is neither believing nor disbelieving, but nor is one any longer consciously considering the question? 2 compare one’s actions as one drives home while engrossed in conversation with someone else in the car. There are many things that one does intentionally without being conscious that one is doing them. There are even decisions, choices that one freely determines at various junctures without necessarily doing so consciously. When one chooses to put the brakes on in response to a red light, one does so intentionally. Plausibly one intends to do so, and one’s intention has a certain content, to put on the brakes, and one derives this intention from the combination of a certain policy and a certain perceptual belief. 3 When one takes up a question and suspends judgment, one may again freely opt not to believe and not to disbelieve (neither affirming nor denying). If so, there’s more to suspending than simply not believing and not disbelieving. This last is done even when one does not so much as consider the question. However, there is even more than not believing and not disbelieving, while considering the question. For (a) this much happens even when one has not yet decided whether to suspend, and (b) there is also suspend- ing when one is not considering the question. 140 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 4 All things considered, then, it seems better to view suspending as intentionally neither affirming nor denying. Moreover, this seems similar to the actions that one performs automatically and subconsciously while driving. It seems like those actions in that one’s performance of them answers to intentions that derive by some sort of reason- ing from policies to which one subscribes at least implicitly and that guide one’s relevant conduct. In the case of belief formation, the policies can concern, among other things, the evidential requirements for proper believing. 5 If so, then suspension is a second‐order matter, since it requires intentions that target first‐order conduct. Also plausibly on the second order, then, are the believing and disbelieving assessable epistemically in the same sort of way as suspending is assessable epistemically. such believing would then be first‐order believing that obeys second‐order intentions in line with proper epistemic policies. 6 There is of course a difference between such believing and disbelieving on the one hand, and the corresponding suspending on the other. On the first order there is not much, if anything at all, that constitutes the suspending. At most there are absences: the absence of believing and the absence of disbelieving. The positive thing that con- stitutes suspending is on the second order. It is the intending to not believe and not disbelieve. Perhaps the forbearing that derives from that intending is on the first order. I mean the forbearing constituted by the intentional neither‐believing‐nor‐disbelieving. But the being intentional of this double‐absence seems to derive from something con- stitutively positive and on the second order: namely, the subject’s intention (conscious or subconscious) to not believe and not disbelieve, an intention that derives from a choice by the subject that implements an evidential policy (whether this choice is made consciously or subconsciously). 7 The foregoing is meant to highlight the importance of second‐order assessment. When we approve of someone’s belief as epistemically justified, often if not always the sort of justification involved is on the second order, or is at least dependent on the second order, since it is justification of that belief as superior to suspension, and hence is plausibly a performance by the subject that is an alternative to suspension (or dependent essentially on an alternative to suspension). such an alternative would be one among mutually exclusive and exhaustive options: believing, disbelieving, sus- pending. If suspending constitutively involves the intention to not first‐order‐believe and to not first‐order‐disbelieve, then plausibly the relevant alternative believing will constitutively involve the intention to first‐order believe, and the relevant alternative disbelieving will constitutively involve the intention to first‐order disbelieve. 2.4 What determines whether suspending is justified? When we intentionally suspend, the justification of our suspending is presumably tied to the justification of our intending to suspend. On what basis might one justifiably so intend? What is it that one endeavors to accomplish by so suspending? One is not endeav- oring to attain truth by adopting that attitude, obviously, since one cannot “attain” truth P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 141 by forbearing from affirming/denying and from believing/disbelieving. One’s objective is rather to avoid falsehood. But one would avoid falsehood by simply checking out of intel- lectual life, by firm and universal suspension, which is not really an option to consider. so, the endeavor is not just to avoid falsehood, but to do so properly, wisely. One does some relevant cost/benefit analysis and forms a corresponding intention. What are the costs and benefits relevant to epistemic choices? On a given question that one takes up, a main cost is false judgment or belief, a main benefit true judgment or belief. so, the pertinent analysis involves relevant risk assessment. What is the likelihood that one will attain truth and avoid falsehood by affirming? What is the risk that one will fail instead? Judgment responsive to these queries should manifest one’s pertinent epistemic competence. One must assess the level of complete competence that one enjoys with respect to the question addressed. This means that one must assess one’s basic constitutional compe- tence, one’s innermost skill in answering such questions. One must assess further the condition that one is in at the time for employing that skill. Is one awake, alert, sober, etc.? And, finally, one may also need to assess one’s situation, including any relevant external relations to the subject matter involved. Is the light adequate? How far is the object? And so on. Only based on such assessment (however quick and subconscious) can one properly determine whether one is likely enough to get it right in answering one’s question. If one reaches a negative conclusion, then one must intentionally forbear from answering the question. One must suspend. One properly affirms, by contrast, when the risk assessment yields a positive conclusion, enabling one intentionally to affirm. so, this proper affirma- tion will then presumably share a basis with the intention that it implements: namely, the basis provided by the positive result of the risk assessment. Hence it will be fully proper only if that positive result amounts to knowledge. so, the affirmation that implements the intention will be fully proper only if it amounts to reflective knowledge full well. That is to say, it must answer the question correctly, and this must manifest the relevant complete competence on the first order, and, moreover, the exercise of that complete competence must itself be intentional, based on the second‐order risk analysis that yields a knowledge- able assessment of the relevant risk. so, that exercise must itself succeed in a way that manifests the subject’s relevant second‐order competence to assess risk. Full epistemic justification is therefore reflective epistemic justification, and this goes beyond the mere reliability of any animal‐level causal process that produces that belief. This is one reason to prefer a full virtue epistemology, with both animal and reflective components. xii 2.5 An alternative bipartisan proposal Rapprochement seems elusive so long as we cleave to a single‐level conception of epis- temic normativity. An attractive bipartisan avenue opens with a bi‐level epistemology. On this approach we distinguish between the animal, stored beliefs that enable us to lead our everyday lives with no need for critical reflection. These are the sorts of beliefs that enable us to drive to work through our familiar route. Many, many such beliefs do their work unattended. The full scope of their activity is suggested when we consider 142 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y that we relax in our chairs because we trust their continued rigidity, that when we get up and walk to leave the room we do not try the shortest route if it involves going through a wall. We automatically head for the door, without scrutinizing the beliefs that guide us there. Many, many of these beliefs enjoy good epistemic standing. We can properly rely upon them, because they are reliable. And they are reliable because they are true, and acquired and sustained with competent truth‐reliability. These beliefs are stored states housed below the surface of our minds, where they can still provide their essential guidance. contrast with such beliefs those constituted by dispositions to affirm upon conscious consideration. These dispositions to judge affirmatively need not accompany the stored beliefs. They may but need not. compare the stored beliefs of a bigot. Those beliefs may guide his bigoted behavior even if on a conscious level he would disavow them, while denying that the target group is inferior. conscious judgment comes to the fore in contexts such as that of the law court, the legislature, the science lab, the physician considering a diagnosis or prognosis, the detec- tive’s investigation, the philosophy seminar room, the thinker’s solitary reflection. Judgments in such contexts are conscious and need to be justified synchronically. Of course, a large part of their justification resides in our second‐order perspective from which we assess our first‐order performance, as we say or think “How do I know this?” Proper answers would presumably take a form such as the following: Because I remember it, or because I can see it to be so, or because she says so and I can trust her on this, and so on. In particular, it is not the standing of the diachronic process, however reliable, that by itself renders our current judgment relevantly justified. The diachronic process might render our current animal belief justified, or, better, “competent.” But this is not enough to make justified the corresponding “voicing” of that stored belief to oneself or to others. For this we need rather synchronic rational justification, and this is not determined by diachronic competence. Here is how Goldman thinks of such factors, the diachronic and the synchronic: suppose Ichabod is being treated by a clinical psychologist, who falsely persuades him that his once‐robust memory is no longer working well; so he has no reason now for supposing that a stored belief of his (like Q) was accurately transmitted from the past. The epistemo- logical critic imagined in the previous paragraph would then have to say that Ichabod is not justified in believing Q. But is this verdict intuitively correct, given that Ichabod in fact reli- ably retained Q from the past and originally acquired the belief in a perfectly sound fashion? At a minimum, Ichabod’s original acquisition and retention of the belief constitute positive forces, or vectors, in support of the justifiedness of his belief. The newly formed beliefs about his powers induced by the psychologist may provide a countervailing epistemic force, a vector that militates in the opposite direction of justifiedness. But that does not negate the fact that his past evidence for Q and subsequent retention of Q are factors prior to the current (noon‐time) belief that positively affect his current justificational status, something denied by evidentialism. (Goldman 2011: sect. 3, penultimate para.) The picture is one of a normative force field with vectors whose clash gives rise to resultant vectors. synchronic and diachronic factors both bear on a status of epistemic justification P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 143 that is determined through the resultant vector. such justification might be positive or negative and its intensity is fixed by the addition of the clashing vectors. Reliabilism does have room for such a picture. Thus, take a case where instrument read- ings clash. The reading on the instrument known to be more reliable should and will then carry more weight, whatever in the end we may conclude. Even if the reading on the less reliable instrument has some weight, it must weigh less, in keeping with its lesser reliability. The magnitude of an epistemic vector will be directly proportional to the degree of reliability of the corresponding factor. Take a question whether p. On that question there will be two directions: the positive and the negative. The factors that favor the positive will have a magnitude proportional to their reliability when combined. similarly for the factors that favor the negative. Presumably the resultant vector’s magnitude will sum the magnitude of the positive vector (with a positive sign) and the magnitude of the negative vector (with a negative sign). The epistemic justification of a belief will be given by a vector that results from the addition of all the positive and negative vectors. That leads to unacceptably counterintuitive results, however, when we consider cases of forgotten evidence. suppose that, on a question whether p, the diachronic positive factors have nearly maximum magnitude, while synchronic negative factors are only slightly negative. What is the subject to do? Pure reliabilism would presumably hold him to be well justified in believing. After all, the overall reliability of so believing is still high if we give no special status to the synchronically available reasons or justification by con- trast with the diachronic process. yet, if we consider just the synchronically available reasons, and the synchronic justification more generally, it can seem extremely plausible that the subject should suspend judgment, even despite how reliabilistically competent is his endorsed belief in actual fact. Rapprochement of the sort entertained by Goldman concerns normatively relevant vectors with magnitudes determined reliabilistically. These are supposed to clash in a single normative field, wherein the normative status of epistemic justification is deter- mined by vector addition. The direction and magnitude of the resultant epistemic justifi- cation would constitute the resultant vector of epistemic justification. But this seems unacceptably counterintuitive when the forgotten evidence and the diachronic process that yield the positive belief are in combination reliable to a degree that approaches the maximum, while the synchronically available justification for the negative is far lower if measured by the reliability of the synchronic competence involved in assessing whether one believes correctly in that positive belief. An alternative route to bipartisan rapprochement may now be worth considering. It seems more promising to distinguish between two sorts of belief. First comes the animal level of belief, the stored belief that can give us the desired guidance in our daily rounds even unendorsed and unattended. second there is the reflective belief constituted by con- scious judgment or disposition to judge. Externalist reliabilism applies mainly to animal belief, while internalist evidentialism applies mainly to the reflective level. However, in both cases there is a crucial element of reliability, and in fully reflective knowledge there is a crucial element of conscious judgment and, most often, of reasons consciously accessible. This is the sort of rapprochement favored in virtue epistemology. I have only sketched it, since here is not the place and now is not the time for a full statement. xiii 144 P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y Notes i Fifty years now Alvin Goldman and I have co‐labored in the field of epistemology, so that, in a deeply appropriate sense, we have collaborated. For that I am most grateful, having always greatly admired his insights, breadth, energy, and productivity. My warm thanks to him for the enormous contributions he has made to our discipline. ii For a response by conee and Feldman, see Dougherty 2011: 302–6. iii There is a problem here for Goldman because he presumably aims to provide an explana- tory account for how a belief is justified. That a belief is inferentially justified would not help explain how it is justified if it turns out that every justified belief will be trivially inferentially justified since justified relative to itself, as it would itself lie within the doxastic evidence relative to which inferential justification would emerge. And just subtracting p itself by special dispensation from the doxastic evidence doesn’t seem to do enough, since there will be plenty of pesky justified beliefs left over trivially, such as the belief that p & (2 is a number). I can see no quick and easy fix if we stick to the approach whereby we first define a certain kind of evidence and then understand doxastically justified or well‐founded belief as belief appropriately based on such evidence. We may be lured to just rule out any beliefs entailing that p from the doxastic evidence relevant to the justification of the belief that p. But this loses its luster when it is seen to block deductively inferential justification. We may try instead to rule out just the belief that p itself. But this will leave in place numerous beliefs that trivially entail p, such as the belief that p & q, for any trivial q. so the requirement that the inferentially justified belief must fit the doxastic evidence will still be satisfied too trivially. It remains unclear, therefore, how we should conceive of the “evidence” that will be relevant to eviden- tialist justification in such a way that “fitting the evidence” will add something worth adding. iv Regardless of whether Goldman would endorse it, moreover, comesaña’s strategy has its own independent interest for whether rapprochement is possible between reliabilism and eviden- tialism. v Italics added with the aim of enhancing clarity. vi Though a better alternative might read: “… are based or might easily be based in conceivable examples.” Thus, suppose after a holocaust the few survivors include a majority subject to various delusions based out of the blue on sheer understanding. Would this affect the justifica- tion and knowledge of those who have been lucky enough to escape the noxious rays or fumes mainly responsible for the delusions? vii normality would not be just statistical, however, as is brought out already by the example in the preceding note. viii This is controversial (though it is not controverted by comesaña, except by adverting to the ground provided by sheer understanding). I enter such controversy in greater detail elsewhere: e.g., in A Virtue Epistemology (2007), and again in work underway (Armchair Philosophy). ix For this claim to be plausible we need to understand the proposition or propositional content u(B) in such a way that through it the believer accesses his relevant belief as his own belief. so, let us take this as given. x Why not just take suspending to be justified if and only if neither believing nor disbelieving is then justified? The “justification” in this proposal cannot well be doxastic justification. After all, as soon as you neither believe nor disbelieve you fail to be justified in believing and fail to be justified in disbelieving. so, according to the proposal you would then automatically be justified in suspending, as soon as you suspend, since as soon as you suspend you fail to believe and fail to disbelieve. On the other hand, if the justification is propositional, the following question comes up: namely, “what would constitute a poor basis for suspending when one has a proper basis P R O c E ss R E l IABI l I s M A n D V IR T u E E PI s TEMO l OG y 145 neither for believing nor for disbelieving?” In response I suggest the following example. you make an arithmetical calculation, and it is simple and you are competent at that sort of calculation. As you approach the conclusion, however, you have already blundered, so that you now lack sufficient reason to draw the ostensible conclusion. As luck would have it you suspend, but the only reason you suspend is that your astrologer told you that you should mistrust such calculations today. Is this not a case where you lack propositional justification for believing the ostensible conclusion of your calculation, and you lack propositional justifi- cation for disbelieving that ostensible conclusion, and yet your basis for suspending is epistemically bad? Once you have blundered or committed a fallacy, you surely will no longer gain justification from your bit of calculational reasoning. xi Though this is, again, subject to the proviso in the preceding note. xii A further reason for allowing the importance of the reflective level involves the role of negligence in epistemic competence. My “Epistemic agency” (2013) develops this theme, and I develop it further in later and forthcoming work. xiii My thanks to Brian Mclaughlin for helpful comments on an earlier version.

If one of your critics is Ernest sosa, you can expect an abundance of acute, incisive, and up‐to‐the‐epistemological‐moment challenges. This expectation has not been disappointed. If only I had more than the meager 1000 words allotted for my response! As things stand, I must be both selective and brief. Fortunately, the main target of sosa’s paper is also the main target of Jack lyons’s (immediately following) contribution. Thus, my two replies to their contributions may jointly provide semi‐satisfactory coverage. A further complica- tion is that I am no longer so persuaded by one of the key features of my paper on which both of them concentrate. In consequence, I shall adopt two different “stances” in my replies. In replying to sosa I shall mainly explain how I was thinking when I wrote my target paper, and in my reply to lyons I shall explain my more recent, slightly different line of thought. Finally, the stringent word limit makes it impossible to cover sosa’s material on virtue epistemology, which is too complex to start to tackle here. sosa focuses on my paper “Toward a synthesis of reliabilism and evidentialism? Or: evidentialism’s troubles, reliabilism’s rescue package.” This paper had three aims. The first was to highlight some serious “troubles” facing evidentialism. The second was to explore prospects for a synthesis of the two views, which might profit each. The exploratory nature of the venture was signaled by the first word (“toward”) in the title, and by the question‐mark that occurs in it. I was just “testing the waters” for a collaborative theory, not attempting a “finished” theory. The third aim was to consider borrowing an element of evidentialism to help resolve certain sticky points in reliabilism. This third idea seems more problematic to me now, but also less pressing, than it did when I wrote “synthesis,” because I now have more confidence in alternative ways to avert the problem(s). (see my reply to Fricker, this volume, in connection with “approved‐list reliabilism.”) Reply to sosa R EP l y T O sO s A 147 sosa devotes a single sentence to my critique of evidentialism, which he ostensibly endorses. This very brief treatment is unfortunate, to my mind, because that material is an important challenge to evidentialism’s viability. (For more on this topic see Beddor 2015). sosa is much less persuaded, clearly, by my sketch of a “two‐factor” theory of justification that tries to marry evidentialism’s central concept, fittingness, with process reliability. The program explores the prospect of a theory in which (A) the fittingness relation and (B) causation by reliable processes jointly provide for justifiedness (defeaters aside). The fittingness relation, in turn, is decomposed into two varieties: (A1) inferential fittingness, between doxastic states of evidence and target attitudes, and (A2) experiential fittingness, between non‐doxastic evidence states and target attitudes. sosa focuses his attention on (A1) and (A2). As indicated in footnote 9 of “synthesis,” I anticipated a division of responsibilities in supplying the details of the envisioned theory. With respect to fittingness, evidentialists should shoulder the burden. This would involve several sub‐tasks: (i) specifying which doxastic attitude tokens can serve as evidence; (ii) specifying the confirmation function; and (iii) specifying how the strength of the evidential states combines with confirmation relations to yield a net “epistemic force” that fixes the normatively appropriate doxastic attitude vis‐à‐vis the target proposition. sosa focuses on sub‐task (i); but this is not the only serious, or tricky, one. I did not regard it as my job to execute these tasks. That must be executed by evidentialists, as the “dowry” they must bring to the marriage. I don’t know whether these tasks can be accomplished; but if they can, the envisaged marriage may be viable. Despite sosa’s worries about the threat of “trivialization,” I don’t yet see that the problem is insuperable. I turn next to the subject of experiential fittingness, an issue that arises, for example, in perception. To offer a two‐factor theory of perceptual justification we need an account of perceptual “fittingness” to provide the first factor. It is assumed that perceptual states are not doxastic states, but nonetheless have representational content. Furthermore, in “synthesis” I proposed that those states can be evidence for the truth of the believed proposition because they are reliable indicators of the subject’s environment. This shows how an evidentialist might explain the evidential status of a perceptual state, thereby making sense of the first factor relevant to perceptual justifiedness. By way of illustration, I discuss a well‐known model in vision science (Biederman 1987) that shows how the visual system represents physical objects via geometrical components (called “geons”) that are combined in the visual system so as to distinguish certain object types from others. Different combinations of geons can be reliable indicators of the presence of a table, a piano, or a dog. What about the second factor, the reliable process factor? If someone experiences a percept involving a certain pattern of geons, this may constitute evidence for him that a certain kind of object is before him. This would satisfy the first‐factor of our two‐factor theory. The second factor will not be satisfied, however, unless he believes there is such an object because a reliable process operates on the geonic combination so as to find a “match” between it and a stored representation of a specified object category (table, piano, or dog). If this reliable process factor is also satisfied, the agent will satisfy the two‐factor require- ments for prima facie perceptual justifiedness. (The perceptually based justification is 148 R EP l y T O sO s A only prima facie because the agent might have extra‐perceptual – for example, inferential – evidence that defeats the perceptual justifiedness.) sosa lodges two objections to the material just reviewed. First, how does the foregoing (experiential) part of the theory help the reliabilist avoid any prominent difficulties? My answer is: “As far as the story told thus far goes, it doesn’t.” But I never thought that every element of the envisioned theory would do this kind of job. The theory has intrinsic attractions apart from any troubleshooting assistance it might provide for (pure) reliabilism. second, sosa complains that I offer only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for justi- fication. This I regard as just wrong. like numerous epistemological theories, I provide sufficient conditions for justifiedness that include a “no‐defeater” clause; and the details of this final clause are postponed for another day. This is as much as most epistemological theories are expected to produce. With respect to counterexample troubleshooting (for example, the case of norman), my initial idea was similar to comesaña’s: add to the sufficiency condition for (doxastic) justification the requirement that the process that produces the belief include some evidence. This would do the job, but is it defensible? lyons (2009) argues against it and with considerable merit. The solution I prefer is “approved‐list reliabilism” (see my reply to Fricker, this volume). But this is no part of any synthesis with evidentialism. References Beddor, B. (2015) Evidentialism, circularity, and grounding. Philosophical Studies 172(7), pp.1847–68. Biederman, I.

L y o ns 7 I regard reliabilism as one of the major achievements of twentieth century philosophy and Alvin Goldman as one of the chief architects of this important theory. There are others, of course; Alston, Armstrong, Dretske, and Sosa leap to mind, to name just a few, but to my mind at least, it would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of Goldman’s (1979) “What is justified belief?” and his subsequent development of the theory in a series of books and papers over the last thirty-some years. Reliabilism provides an anti‐Cartesian alternative to the internalist epistemologies so widely assumed and deeply entrenched at the time that reliabilism must have initially looked to many like some kind of conceptual mistake (it still does to some). At the same time, reliabilism serves the pro‐Cartesian goal of bringing philosophy into consonance with the sciences, thus counteracting the post‐ Fregean a priorism also entrenched at the time. In at least these two ways, reliabilism has dramatically changed the face of epistemology, and changed it – I think – for the better. I find a version of reliabilism to be very plausible; I’m attracted in particular to a version that fits well with much that Goldman has endorsed over the years. My criti- cism of Goldman’s recent work, therefore, will involve matters of detail or elaboration, as I see nothing deeply or fundamentally wrong with Goldman’s overarching episte- mology. In addition, I’m not even sure that Goldman is really committed to denying anything that I offer here. Much of Goldman’s latest epistemological writings have been either polemical (for example, Goldman 2009b, 2011b) or aimed at more general theses (for example, 2009a), and it has been several years since we have gotten a detailed and definitive summary statement of his reliabilism. I want to focus on three related issues in Goldman’s epistemology. Goldman has recently been making friendly overtures toward evidentialist epistemologies, and although I agree that reliabilism needs some kind of evidentialist element, I disagree with the 150 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y details of Goldman’s proffered rapprochement. More specifically, I think he concedes too much to the evidentialist. In particular, he concedes: 1 that a great many beliefs cannot be justified without evidence, in particular, that some beliefs require nondoxastic evidence 2 that evidential fit can be understood in non‐process‐reliabilist terms, and 3 that the aforementioned or some similar understanding of evidential fit makes sense of propositional, or ex ante, justification. I will address these in sections 1–3 below, respectively. I offer some concluding comments in section 4. 1 The Need for (Nondoxastic) Evidence Goldman has taken an interest in evidence in recent papers (for example, 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2011a, 2011b), and in some of these (2009a, especially 2011b) he explicitly advocates a “syn- thesis” of some stripe or other. In “Toward a synthesis of reliabilism and evidentialism?” (2011b) he defends a kind of evidentialist reliabilism, which is intended to improve on both evidentialism and reliabilism by combining elements of both in a single theory. Some notori- ous problem cases for reliabilism  –  for example, bonJour’s (1980) case of norman the clairvoyant and lehrer’s (1990) Truetemp case – can be handled by requiring that the agent have some evidence, or ground, for the belief, in addition to process reliability. That’s eviden- tialism’s contribution to reliabilism. i not very surprisingly, good evidence will be understood partly or entirely in terms of reliability; that’s reliabilism’s contribution to evidentialism. Reliabilists who have signed a purity pledge won’t like this, but I think Goldman is right to hold that some beliefs require evidential support. We disagree, however, about the nature, location, and extent of the evidential requirement. The view I want to posit, as an alternative to his, is the fairly straightforward view that (a) all evidence is doxastic (that is, only beliefs can serve as evidence), and (b) some, but not all, beliefs require evidence. Importantly, whether a belief requires (doxastic) evidence is not simply a matter of whether that belief was actually the result of an inferential process; there will be non‐inferentially formed beliefs (in Goldman’s terms, beliefs resulting from belief‐independent processes) that nevertheless require evidential/inferential support in order to be justified. Thus, Goldman’s original (1979) theory gets it wrong about belief‐independent processes: not all outputs of reliable belief‐independent processes are (prima facie) justified. Reliability is sufficient for the prima facie justification of only some belief‐independent processes. The upshot of this is that there are some pairs of agents and propositions such that that agent is not justified in believing that proposition unless s/he has (doxastic) evidence for it. Put another way, there are some propositions that cannot be the content of any epistemo- logically basic belief of some agent.ii For example, supposing the agent to be you or me or some other normal human, the following all seem intuitively to be the sorts of belief that can be justified only if the agent has some evidence, in particular, some doxastic evidence: G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 151 The Republicans will take over the Senate in the next election. Dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens. evidentialism is false. Sacagawea was 16 and pregnant when she joined the lewis and Clark expedition. The hen in front of me has 42 speckles. All of these seem intuitively to be non‐basic beliefs; the sort of beliefs that require support from other beliefs. (Some of these may be proper objects of memory, in which case doxas- tic support may be unnecessary; I’m imagining these here and henceforth to be new beliefs, not memory beliefs.) but even Goldman’s newer forms of reliabilism don’t pre- clude these from being the outputs of reliable belief‐independent processes, which means he gets the intuitively wrong answers, counting these beliefs as justified, even when the agent has no evidence for them. His recent use of nondoxastic evidence doesn’t go far enough. I want to argue two points: (a) that some beliefs do require evidence, in addition to process reliability, but also (b) that no beliefs require nondoxastic evidence. Regarding (b), I should note that Goldman (2011b) is more concerned to show that evidentialism needs reliabilism than to show that reliabilism needs evidentialism, so it is hard to know whether he really thinks that some beliefs really do require (nondoxastic) evidence in addition to reliable formation or whether this is a concession to the evidentialist for the sake of argu- ment. If he is not fully committed to this role for nondoxastic evidence (and thus for evidence‐utilizing belief‐independent processes), then my comments should be read as offering suggestions, rather than objections.iii 1.1 The nature of evidence I should say what I mean by “evidence.” The term is notoriously slippery, and an exami- nation of the ordinary language usage is unlikely to be of much help, since the term has a specialized meaning in epistemology, perhaps even a more specialized meaning yet among epistemologists of the “S knows that p” crowd. There are two main questions concerning the nature of evidence, one about the evi- dence relation, and one about the evidence relatum: what is it to serve as evidence for a belief? And what kinds of things are candidates for serving as evidence? To answer the second question, I defer to what I take to be Conee and Feldman’s core conception of the evidence relatum: one’s evidence is limited to those mental states (events, properties, etc.) on which one might base a belief, in particular, beliefs and nondoxastic experiences.iv Their mentalism requires that evidence be internal to the mind of the cognizer, and their theory of well‐foundedness (that is, doxastic, or ex post, justification) requires that the belief be based on the evidence. This understanding of evidence is partly terminologi- cal  –  evidence is that on which one does or might base a belief  –  and partly substan- tive – the only things on which one might base beliefs in the relevant sense are mental states. v So evidence – the relatum – is one’s reason, or ground, for a belief, that on which one does or might base the belief, that which one “has to go on in forming beliefs” 152 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y (Conee and Feldman 2008: 88). There is nothing normative about “evidence” in this sense. evidence – the relation – on the other hand, is what makes a piece of evidence good evidence, a cogent reason, a justifying ground, etc. Here we can’t simply defer to Conee and Feldman, for the debate about what makes something a good reason is too fundamental, too substantive, to simply hand over to the internalists. vi Conee and Feldman, of course, think that the evidential relation is a matter of a belief ’s fitting with, or being a proper doxastic response to, a given ground. Goldman rightly complains that they need to tell us much more about this mysterious notion of fit, especially given the absolutely central role it plays in their epistemology. (As far as I can tell, he accepts their view, as I have cast it above, concerning the evidence relata.) He offers instead, a two‐factor theory of the evidence relation, which holds that in order for a piece of evidence e to confer justification on a belief h, e must not only (i) be an input to a reliable cognitive process that results in h, but there must also (ii) be an objective relation of fit between e and h: e must confirm h, render h probable, etc. Modifying his illustrative example slightly, Shirley and Madeleine both believe h to a high degree on the basis of e, and the objective confirmation e confers on h is indeed high. However, while Madeleine assigns a high credence to h as the result of her “well‐honed skills at determining degrees of support,” Shirley has no idea how to determine whether e con- firms h and is simply guessing. both Shirley’s and Madeleine’s beliefs fit the evidence, but Madeleine’s belief is justified, while Shirley’s is not. one way we might gloss this is by saying that, while e is evidence of h in some detached, disembodied sense, it is only the reliable cognitive process that makes e evidence of h for anyone. In this case, it makes e evidence of h, for Madeleine but not for Shirley. 1.2 Doxastic evidence let us return to the intuitively nonbasic beliefs listed above, like “evidentialism is false” and “Sacagawea was 16 and pregnant when she joined the lewis and Clark expedition.” These beliefs are unjustified for agents more or less like us, unless the agent has some argument or other beliefs to support these beliefs. yet we can imagine the target beliefs resulting from reliable processes, even processes that take nondoxastic experiences as inputs, and it doesn’t change our intuitive verdict. Although Goldman’s view has always been a kind of process, rather than indicator, reliabilism, he has been making explicit efforts recently (2009b, 2011a) to emphasize the superiority of process reliabilism over indicator reliabilism and related views. Here is another point where I agree wholeheartedly with Goldman; process reliabilism is vastly superior to indicator reliabilism – an issue to which we will return in section 2. For now, let us simply notice that it is all too easy to use these intuitively nonbasic beliefs against indicator reliabilism: I have some arbitrary sensation that causes me to believe that Sacagawea was 16 and pregnant when she joined the lewis and Clark expedition; because this belief is true, the sensation is a reliable indicator, and the theory counts the belief as justified. It is less easy to cause trouble for process reliabilism, however; the examples will have to be elaborated in much more detail. G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 153 Consider, then, the reasoning you and I would go through to figure out that Sacagawea was pregnant when she joined the expedition. Imagine we start out knowing that she had a six‐month‐old infant in August of 1805, and that she joined the expedition in november of 1804. Counting backward from August 1805, we reason that the baby must have been born in February 1805, and so Sacagawea must have been pregnant for several months before that (approximately nine; a severely premature infant wouldn’t have lived long in the wilderness, in 1805), which makes her about six months pregnant as of november 1804. This is a perfectly typical, justification‐conferring sort of inference. now suppose that Sarah (an otherwise normal human) reasons similarly, from the same premises (Sacagawea joined in november 1804, and she had a six‐month‐old in August 1805). She uses the same reliable reasoning process you and I do, but with an important difference: Sarah’s reasoning is entirely unconscious; she is neither aware of the lemmas nor of the truth of the various suppressed premises. Sarah doesn’t know (that is, has no belief about) what month or year the baby was born, how long a typical preg- nancy lasts, how many months are in a year and what order they come it, etc. To make matters worse, suppose that Sarah acquired this reasoning capacity as the result of a neu- rosurgery carried out on her last night without her knowledge; yesterday afternoon she’d have concluded nothing from these same premises. Intuitively, Sarah is not justified in this belief, even though it results from a reliable process. We could imagine a variant case where even more of the process is unconscious: the visual experience you and I have when seeing the printed sentences “Sacagawea had a six‐month‐old infant in August of 1805” and “Sacagawea joined the lewis and Clark expedition in november of 1804” serves as input to the pertinent processes, even though Sarah herself doesn’t even (consciously) know how to read. There may be cognizers who could solve this problem intuitively, in a single step, with- out doing any math, simply “seeing” that Sacagawea must have been pregnant, in the way that I might “see” that two glimpses of a clock are (some multiple of) six hours apart. but I am not such a cognizer, and I presume Sarah’s surgery need not make her one either. once again, then, we have a case where reliability is not sufficient; the agent must have some evidence. not only evidence; the agent must have some doxastic evidence, and in fact, the agent must have some fairly specific doxastic evidence. It’s not just that she’s basing the belief on a reliable indicator; she’s using the same process we are (hence, an equally reliable process) but without having the same evidence. Goldman does, of course, allow that evidence may be required for the justification of some beliefs. However, this requirement is not strong enough, for he needs to require not just evidence, but doxastic evidence. nondoxastic evidence is not enough to help with the relevant cases. For those cases where reliabilism needs to add an evidence requirement, it is a doxastic evidence requirement that is needed. I agree with Goldman that not all beliefs require evidence; but I insist that those that do, require doxastic evidence, and experien- tial evidence contributes nothing to reliabilism. The most obvious cases of unjustified though reliably formed belief involve the sudden, perhaps unknown to the agent, advent of novel cognitive capacities. Truetemp is like this, and the norman case is most compelling if the details are filled in this way (see lyons 2009 for a lengthier discussion). Suppose, then, that norman and Truetemp have 154 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y nondoxastic sensations that feed into reliable clairvoyance and temperature detecting processes, respectively. We can imagine that the sensations are old and familiar (normal thermal sensations, spontaneous visual imagery) but that the reliable process, with the accompanying belief, is novel. yesterday, when Truetemp had this temperature sensation, he wasn’t justified in believing that it was 103° outside, but today he is? This doesn’t seem very plausible, but it gets even worse if we vary the sensations. Truetemp’s surgeons may have arranged it so that he has an unusual auditory sensation, whose pitch correlates with ambient temperature, an auditory sensation that feeds into a reliable temperature‐sensing process. Truetemp, of course, has no reason to believe he has this new capacity, that the auditory sensations reliably co‐vary with temperature, etc. Intuitively, this experiential evidence variation on the Truetemp case provides us with an instance of unjustified belief. In fact, this belief seems just as intuitively unjustified as the original Truetemp case. (Analogous considerations apply to the norman case, but I won’t bother making the mod- ifications explicit.) Again, it is not just that norman and Truetemp are basing unjustified beliefs on reliable indicators, but they’re using processes that are reliable in whatever sense our perceptual processes are reliable. Presumably, however, if Truetemp were justified in believing that these sensations correlated in the appropriate way with the ambient temperature, then his beliefs about the latter would, in fact, be justified. So nondoxastic evidence doesn’t justify Truetemp’s belief, while doxastic evidence would. If, therefore, we want to handle the Truetemp case by requiring him to have evidence for this temperature belief, it should be doxastic evidence that we require. Goldman’s aforementioned two‐factor theory might seem to offer him some help in responding to these sorts of objections. Goldman might argue that the experiences I’m invoking in my counterexamples do not fit with the beliefs they cause; thus, even though the process reliability factor is satisfied, the fittingness factor is not, so his theory doesn’t get the wrong result after all. This response won’t help Goldman, however. First, let us consider the view that evidential fit is a necessary, two‐place relation: if e is evidence of h for S, then e necessarily, and for any S, fits with h. I call this view “evidence essentialism.” For evidence essential- ism to ward off the present counterexamples, one would have to claim that no possible agent could have precise temperature beliefs that are justified by the auditory or thermo- ceptive sensations described above. but surely some possible agent could have justified, epistemologically basic, and highly precise beliefs about the ambient temperature, and if experiences ever serve as evidence for basic beliefs, these experiences seem like fine candidates for doing so. Similarly for clairvoyance: clairvoyance could produce justified basic beliefs in some possible organisms, and the same sensation that intuitively does not justify norman in believing that p could justify some other possible creature in believing that p. If so, then that sensation fits with p, in the relevant sense. vii In any case, and to his credit, Goldman rejects this view of evidential fit in favor of one that sees it as a contingent four‐ (or more‐) place relation among the evidence, the justificandum belief, the organism, and the environment. Goldman (2011b) instead endorses a reliable indicator theory of evidential fit (factor (ii)), to complement the pro- cess reliabilist factor (factor (i)) that is also necessary for evidential justification. However, G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 155 this understanding of evidential fittingness doesn’t help with the present problem either. Truetemp’s sensations do reliably indicate the truth of the corresponding beliefs; similarly for norman (and Sarah). So the norman and Truetemp cases stand; they show  –  or seem to, anyhow  –  that certain beliefs require doxastic evidence, that reliability is not enough. Goldman’s new conjunction of indicator reliability and process reliability does not make headway with these cases. one could, of course, take a very hard line on reliabilism, biting the bullet and insisting that reliability really is sufficient for justification and thus that norman and Sarah and the others are justified, our contrary intuitions notwithstanding. This has never been Goldman’s approach, however; he has always taken these sorts of objections seriously. That he has always done so is an important feature of his view; among other things, it makes it much harder for the internalist to get away with the apparently popular claim that the externalist is simply changing the subject and talking about something other than what the internalist has always been talking about. 1.3 The role of experience It is not just that nondoxastic experiences might account for what is missing in certain well‐known cases of reliably produced but unjustified belief. Goldman has another argu- ment for thinking that reliabilism would be improved by incorporating experiential evidence. The argument is that experiences that have not been fed into any instantiated processes can nevertheless serve as defeaters for certain beliefs; the best explanation for this is that the experiences serve as undermining evidence to these beliefs. For example, Sidney has a prima facie justified belief that it will be sunny today, but this belief is defeated by his current perceptual experience, despite the fact that this experience is not producing any contrary beliefs (2011b: 271–2). This is an odd argument for Goldman to espouse, for two reasons. First, as he is well aware, there is a competing explanation that explains the defeat without any mention of evidence. Second, on Goldman’s two‐factor theory of evidence, this experience doesn’t count as evidence anyway. Goldman has offered different accounts of defeat over the years, but perhaps the best is his original (1979) alternative reliable process (ARP) account, according to which, S’s prima facie justification for p is defeated just in case there is an alternative reliable process available to S, which, if used in addition to or instead of the one actually used, would have resulted in S’s not believing that p. This view is problematic in various ways, some of the details of which will concern us later, but if it is even remotely on track, it offers a simple solution to the current problem. If Sidney is having a perceptual experience as of walking in a rainstorm, then – assuming Sidney is a reliable perceiver – there is a reliable percep- tual process available to him which would result in his not believing that it’s sunny, which, by ARP, defeats his justification for believing that it’s sunny. notice that the ARP solution only gives us the desired result (that Sidney is unjusti- fied) if Sidney’s perceptual processes are both reliable and available to him. but this seems 156 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y just right; if we waive either of these assumptions (for example, suppose Sidney is terribly unreliable in these circumstances or that he is suffering from an agnosia that makes it impossible for him to form perceptual beliefs), then Sidney no longer seems to be unjusti- fied in believing that it is sunny. Such considerations, in fact, make it look as if ARP actu- ally handles the case better than an evidentialist theory. Supposing the experience to be defeating evidence when Sidney’s perceptual processes are reliable and available, either (a) the experience remains evidence when these processes are not reliable and available, or (b) the experience ceases to be evidence in these conditions. If (b), then something very much like ARP is already being tacitly smuggled in, and the evidentialist view is not a genuine alternative; if (a), then Sidney ought to be unjustified in believing it’s sunny even if he has the agnosia, but he does not seem to be unjustified in this case. Goldman has not, of course, forgotten about ARP. but he thinks it is problematic in various ways and that the evidential view improves on it (2011b: note 15). I am in the process of arguing that the evidential view does not improve on it, but I want to also insist that we will need to hang onto something like ARP anyhow, for there are cases of defeat that don’t appear to involve evidence. Recall Kornblith’s (1983) case of the headstrong physicist whose pride prevents him from even hearing a colleague’s crushing objection to his view; intuitively, the physicist is unjustified. Goldman (1992) discusses this alongside Holly Smith’s example of a doctor who has good prima facie reasons for believing that p but has medical journals on her desk that she should have been reading and that would have undermined these prima facie reasons; the doctor is unjustified. These are highly problematic cases for standard versions of evidentialism, but they are easily handled by ARP or something like it. Feldman and Conee (1985) respond to Kornblith’s physicist case by claiming that, so long as the physicist genuinely doesn’t hear the objection – even though he could, were he to stop being so dogmatic for a moment – his original belief remains justified and undefeated. Goldman could take this route, but it doesn’t strike me as an attractive solution, and I doubt it would strike other reliabilists as attractive either. Thus, we seem to need some kind of ARP clause anyhow; why not let it do double duty and handle the Sidney case as well? The second complaint is that, on Goldman’s two‐factor theory of evidence, the Sidney case isn’t a case of evidential defeat anyhow. let us suppose that the experience does fit the belief that it is not sunny outside, so the fittingness factor is satisfied. Still, as Goldman insists, Sidney’s perceptual experience of rain does not feed into any instantiated process, so the process factor is not satisfied. Goldman can’t claim that this is a case of defeat by contrary evidence, for this is not, on Goldman’s view, a case of evidence! He could, of course, expand the reliable process factor to include uninstantiated but available processes, but this defeats the purpose of the example, which was supposed to render ARP and its ilk unnecessary. The expanded view would be a version of ARP with extra (evidential) com- plications tacked on and no good indication that those complications were really paying their own way. Alternatively, Goldman could claim that fittingness yields propositional justification, while using a reliable process is necessary for doxastic justification. (The distinction between propositional and doxastic justification will get more attention later; roughly, propositional justification attaches to a proposition if it’s in some sense the epistemically G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 157 right thing for the agent to believe, whether the agent does or doesn’t believe it; doxastic justification attaches only to beliefs that are properly held.) So Sidney is in a state that indicates it’s raining, which thus propositionally justifies Sidney in believing it’s raining, and this propositional justification defeats his justification for believing that it’s sunny. Goldman hints that he might intend for fittingness to capture propositional justification; considering a different case where the subject’s experience serves as a reliable indicator, he asks “[m]ust we add a process‐reliability component…? yes. otherwise…we won’t have a satisfactory account of doxastic as opposed to propositional justifiedness” (2011b: 274; however, also see 2011b: note 11). This would evade the worries just leveled, but only if it is plausible to hold that reliable indication yields propositional justification, a topic I return to in section 2 below. To anticipate, I think it is not. Thus, the Sidney example does not argue for any evidential role for nondoxastic experiences. 1.4 Perception and nondoxastic evidence I have been arguing against Goldman’s attempt to strengthen reliabilism by the incorpo- ration of nondoxastic evidence, claiming that this constitutes too much of a concession to evidentialism. yet I have insisted myself that a pure version of reliabilism is off the table, that some beliefs require evidence in addition to process reliability. In fact, Goldman never explicitly even claims that evidence is necessary for the justification of any beliefs, only that it can contribute to justification. Why should my appeal to doxastic evidence be any less of a concession to evidentialism than Goldman’s appeal to nondoxastic evidence? First, though Goldman doesn’t explicitly require doxastic evidence, I think it is an ines- capable addition to any adequate reliabilist epistemology. The Sacagawea case above, as well as the Truetemp and norman cases, seem to indicate that doxastic evidence is sometimes required for justification. These agents are unjustified, and supplying them with the right experiences doesn’t help – what they are missing are beliefs. viii More modestly, I think that anyone who does not just deny these intuitive verdicts in favor of a simple or pure reliabi- lism will have to incorporate doxastic evidence, and Goldman does not want to deny these intuitive verdicts. Provided that the theories agree about which beliefs require doxastic evidence, a reliabilism that countenances only doxastic evidence involves less of a conces- sion to evidentialism than one that countenances that, plus a host of nondoxastic evidence. This leads to a more significant point. It is very plausible to hold that perception is epistemically belief‐independent, in the sense that perceptual beliefs can be justified without any evidential support from other beliefs. If we conjoin this claim with the view that all evidence is doxastic evidence, then we end up with an epistemology according to which perceptual beliefs are justified in a way that does not involve evidence of any sort. Clearly this view is highly inimical to evidentialism. Goldman does insist on the possibil- ity of justified beliefs that don’t involve evidence: introspective beliefs, preservative memory beliefs where the original evidence has been forgotten, etc.ix but his treatment of clairvoyance makes it out to be a quasi‐perceptual capacity, and this leads him to the claim that nondoxastic experiences have an evidential role to play in perception and in those cases of memory that involve distinctive memorial experiences (2011b: 271–2). 158 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y notice I am only denying that experiences play an evidential role, not that they play an epistemic role of some other sort. My perceptual experience might produce in me a justi- fied introspective belief that I’m appeared to F‐ly, and if I’m justified in thinking that being appeared to F‐ly typically accompanies something’s being F, then I have an additional justification for thinking something is F. experiences might therefore play an indirect role in producing propositional or ex ante justification for perceptual or memory beliefs (or rather, inferential beliefs with the same content as perceptual or memory beliefs), without ever playing a direct or evidential role or figuring in the doxastic justi- fiedness of ordinary unreflective perception and memory. The role for experiences is quite indirect on this view, however. experiences are mere causes, rather than reasons, in just the way external objects are. As such, their role is parasitic on the reliability of intro- spection, the justification for the belief that there’s usually something F nearby when I’m appeared to F‐ly, and so on. In any case, I am not committed to denying that having expe- riences is epistemically better than not having them. A basic belief is standardly conceived as one that does not depend on evidential support from other beliefs for its justification, though this is compatible with its requiring eviden- tial support from nondoxastic states. If, as I have been urging, all evidence is doxastic evidence, then the detente with evidentialism is possible only where nonbasic beliefs are concerned. evidence plays no role in the justification of basic beliefs. Provided that we have some antecedent or independent way of distinguishing basic beliefs from nonbasic beliefs – something we will all need if, as I say, some beliefs do require doxastic evidence and some do not  –  then this gives us our distinction between the beliefs that require evidence and those that do not. Goldman, however, will require not just a way of distin- guishing basic from nonbasic beliefs, but also a way of distinguishing between those basic beliefs that require evidence and those that do not. 2 Reliability and Evidential Fit There is an intuitively appealing idea, according to which if one thing is evidence for another, then that evidential relation is an objective feature of the world, one which does not depend in any way on us, or any other cognizers. This would prop up a second intui- tively appealing idea: that evidential relations are already out there when organisms come along and make use of them; justification results from cognizers exploiting preexisting evidential relations in the world. Despite their intuitive plausibility, however, these are highly problematic claims, especially in the context of process reliabilism. “evidence essentialism” is the already encountered view that if e is evidence of h for S, then necessarily, and for any S, e is evidence of h. We saw some problems for evidence essentialism above (see also lyons 2009, 2013), and Goldman isn’t tempted by such a view, so I won’t discuss it further. The first of our two appealing ideas either is evidence essentialism or is near enough as to be subject to very similar problems. The second appealing idea is considerably more modest, for it recognizes that an evidence relation might be perfectly objective without being cognizer‐independent. If, for example, a certain sensation in me reliably indicates a certain chemical property, then this G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 159 is a perfectly objective fact – it is not, for instance, dependent on my beliefs about the matter – even if in other organisms the same sensation occurs randomly, or if it indicates something different for them. even though indication is thus cognizer‐dependent, it is still objective and “out there in the world,” to be exploited, at least in the very important sense that it is not subjective, or dependent on that cognizer’s perspective or beliefs. This second idea is, I think, what Goldman intends to capture with the fittingness factor of his two‐factor theory of evidence. The problem with it is one which I expect Goldman may appreciate: reliable indication is not really an epistemic good‐making feature and hence not properly included as a factor in a theory of evidence. 2.1 The epistemic irrelevance of indication Recall the standard examples. Shirley is terrible at determining confirmation levels but guesses that the probability of h|e is high, thus believing h on the basis of e (in a case where the probability of h|e really is high). Sarah believes that Sacagawea was pregnant on the basis of reliable evidence whose evidential significance Sarah is not in a position to appreciate. The novice bird‐watcher believes that there’s a pink spotted flycatcher on the basis of a visual experience identical to that which justifies the expert in believing thus, even though the novice is leaping to conclusions (Feldman 2003). To say that the eviden- tial relation consists of two factors, one of which is satisfied in these cases, is to suggest that there is something these agents are doing right, even if they fall short of justification. but this seems wrong; why think these agents are doing anything epistemically right at all?  Goldman hints that they are propositionally but not doxastically justified (2011b: 274), but if so, this only shows the scant value of propositional justification (section 3, below). even though, for example, Shirley’s belief “fits” her evidence, it seems that there is absolutely nothing that she’s doing epistemically right, no more so than believing truths for bad reasons. Given the unreliability of the process she uses – and the unreliability of all the processes she could feasibly use – she is no better off epistemically in believing a proposition that fits her evidence than one that does not. To take another of Goldman’s own examples (2015): Chad believes that p on the basis of p ∨ q and ∼ q, but not because he appreciates the validity of disjunctive syllogism or has that rule “hard wired” or the like, but rather, because any time he encounters a proposi- tion of the form “p % q” (where “%” is some logical operator) he infers p. Again, it seems that Chad is completely unjustified in believing p. He is no better off epistemically than he would have been had he believed p on the basis of p ∨ q and q, or some other non‐reliably‐indicative ground. A well‐known fact that causes problems for many epistemological views is that the conditional probability of any necessary truth given any piece of evidence is 1. on Goldman’s view, it appears that even the most obscure necessary truth has something going for it, for whatever reason one may believe it. Worse, believing a necessary truth for some apparently frivolous reason will result in a better epistemic status than believing it for no reason at all. let w be whatever the true proposition is that states the 234th digit of the decimal expansion of pi. I have no idea what the 234th digit is, but if I believe w on the 160 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y basis of the claim that cats have fur, then I’m epistemically better off, on Goldman’s view, than if I merely believed w without basing it on anything. This is because w fits my evidence in the one case (where I have evidence on which I’m basing it) and not in the other case (where I don’t). but surely this is wrong; not only have I pulled w itself out of the air, but I’ve pulled “cats have fur” out of the air as well, as a belief on which to base w. If anything, this ought to make my epistemic position worse, not better.x Thus, reliable indication adds nothing to the agent’s evidential status, and Goldman’s two‐factor theory of evidence should be rejected in favor of one that posits only a single, process reliability, factor. Goldman claims that “on one dimension of justifiedness – the fittingness dimension – Shirley and Madeleine’s doxastic attitudes vis‐a‐vis h deserve the same rating… A two‐factor theory handles this case nicely. but no single‐factor theory, of either the purely evidentialist or purely [process] reliabilist sort, can do so” (2011b: 264). but if the dimension on which they deserve the same rating is not genuinely an epistemic dimension, a “dimension of justifiedness,” then a single‐factor theory (of the purely process reliabilist sort) does just fine.xi Traditional versions of foundationalism used to claim that beliefs about the current contents of one’s own mind were basically justified because they were infallible. but this claim was always problematic, for we have plenty of other beliefs that are infallible but not in the slightest bit justified, for example, lucky guesses about obscure necessary truths. Infallibility is just an extreme form of reliability, and the epistemic importance of reliabil- ity was, of course, one of the central insights of Goldman’s original (1979) defense of justificational reliabilism. but the other, equally important insight – without which the epistemic significance of reliability is at best unclear – was the importance of processes. no matter how objectively likely p is to be true, no matter how conditionally probable p is relative to a body of evidence, belief in p is unjustified if it is arrived at by way of the wrong kind of process. We think now of “What is justified belief?” as arguing primarily for an externalist theory of justification, but it is clear that one of Goldman’s primary concerns at the time was to establish a genetic or historical theory of justification, one that saw justification as essentially involving ways of coming to believe. These are not inde- pendent concerns. The epistemic importance of reliability is, I submit, yoked to and dependent on the epistemic importance of belief‐forming processes. over and over, Goldman (1979) gives us examples of intuitively unjustified beliefs that nevertheless sat- isfy all the requirements endorsed by previous epistemologists who were not sensitive to the role of processes. Furthermore, the intuitive verdict, then and now, seems to be not just that these beliefs are partly flawed but that they have nothing going for them, justifi- cationally speaking, save perhaps for some very raw potential, were the agent to form beliefs in a vastly different manner.xii 2.2 Indicators and processes Goldman has never lost sight of the epistemic significance of ways of coming to believe, and he is well aware of the differences between process reliabilism and indicator reliabilism. Reliable indication does not imply process reliability, and this gap allows for the objections G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 161 to indicator reliabilism Goldman and I have been pressing, here and elsewhere (Goldman 2009b, 2011a, 2011b; lyons 2009, 2011). but does process reliability require reliable indication? More specifically, suppose that a reliable process takes e as evidential input and produces h as output, does this require that e is a reliable indicator of h? To answer this, we’ll need to get a bit more clear on the crucial concepts of both indication and processes. Reliable indication is supposed to be a relation that holds from a belief to a belief and also from a nondoxastic experience to a belief. These are significantly different, however. let’s say that state indication is when the occurrence of state e indicates the truth of h (that is, the conditional probability of h given the occurrence of e is high), and that content indication is when the truth of e indicates the truth of h (that is, the conditional probability of h given the truth of e is high). The natural move for indicator reliabilists is to invoke content indication for doxastic evidence and state indication for nondoxastic evidence. xiii now, depending on how one individuates processes, the connection between indica- tion and process reliability might be tight indeed. Comesaña’s (2010) evidentialist reliabi- lism insists that, if e is the evidential input to a process that results in the belief that h, the relevant process type is the type producing a belief that h on the basis of e. but the reliability of that process type is simply going to be the conditional probability of h given e. That is, Comesaña’s proposal is a type of indicator reliabilism, with some surface features of process reliabilism. To keep the process/indicator distinction from collapsing, the indi- viduation of the processes has to be divorced from the contents of the representations over which the processes operate. If inferring p from q counts as a process, then process reliabilism will face the very problems that plague indicator reliabilism, as does Comesaña’s theory, for example. The idea behind process reliabilism is that for me to be justified in inferring r from s, this must be due to a more general competence, a competence for infer- ring truths (like r) from things like s. Perhaps it is part of the very nature of a competence to be at least somewhat general: mere consistency of inference (I always infer r from s) is compatible with a justification‐killing form of luck; I’m not necessarily competent just because I get this one thing right, even if I get it right habitually.xiv With processes and indication slightly better understood, we can return to the ques- tion whether evidence‐involving process reliability requires reliable indication. one way in which a process might be reliable without its evidential inputs reliably indicating its outputs is if the process requires other inputs that don’t count as part of the agent’s evidence. Such inputs may include unconscious detection of lighting conditions, direc- tion of gravitational pull, even pheromones, which do not count as part of the agent’s evidence, in part because of their inaccessibility to the agent, and in part because their role as evidence is far from apparent. Depth perception utilizes unconscious cues, like binocu- lar disparity, and conscious cues, like “aerial perspective,” whose status as cues and whose evidential significance is known to few aside from perceptual psychologists and painters. I do not assume in general that all evidence must be consciously dwelt upon, but I do think that for something to count as my evidence for a belief I must be at least tacitly aware of its evidential significance, which requires it to be at least potentially conscious. If I can remain justified in believing p while justifiedly believing ~ q, then q is not an indispensable part of my evidence for p. Such is the case with these arcane or unconscious perceptual cues. So even if the total input to the process reliably indicates a given belief, the evidential 162 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y part of that input might not: the probability of h|e + n might be high even though the probability of h|e is low. This is presumably the function of the nonevidential inputs, to make the overall process more reliable. even the total input to a process need not reliably indicate the output in order for the process to be reliable. Process reliability is determined by what the process does across the range of its inputs; it is something like the conditional probability of true output given some typical input or other, not the conditional probability of true output given this par- ticular input. Unless this particular input is the only input the process ever receives, these values are likely to be different. Consider, for example, the visual experience Henry has when he looks at a barn in barn facade country. Due to his environment, this experience is a poor, that is, unreliable, indicator of the presence of barns. yet the visual process in play is one that also produces beliefs about chairs, cats, rocks, constellations, and the like. Thus, given that Henry’s environment is normal aside from the barn facades, the visual process is reliable, even though the barn percept is not a reliable indicator of barns. Process reliability requires that the inputs in general reliably indicate the outputs in general, but this is far from the kind of reliable indication that indicator reliabilism has in mind. Goldman (2011b) claims that both the process reliability and the fittingness factors are needed to account for evidential justification. The Madeleine/Shirley case shows why fit is not enough, but is there any reason to think that fit is an indispensable element, that process reliability is not enough? Henry’s belief that there’s a barn in front of him fails to satisfy the fit component, at least as cashed out in indicator reliabilist terms. nevertheless, he seems to be perfectly well justified, which can be explained by the fact that the more general visual processes he is using are reliable, even in this environment. If we want to understand visual experiences as constituting evidence for perceptual beliefs, their status as evidence seems to be fully captured by the role they play in a reliable process. The other factor – fittingness – is idle. Reliable indication is neither necessary nor sufficient for process reliability. We have seen why process reliability is an indispensable component in an epistemological theory, but we have not yet seen any distinctive role for indication to play. Process reliability does not entail reliable indication, so an indicator requirement is far from a harmless unpack- ing of what was already included in the process requirement. Indication seems to be nei- ther conducive to justification when it is present without process reliability, nor detrimental to justification when absent, so long as process reliability remains. I think, therefore, that we are better off with a theory of evidence that holds that e is evidence of h for S only if S’s belief that h is the result of a reliable process, among the inputs to which is e. This is only a necessary condition, but there is no reason to think that the full and final view will make any reference to reliable indication. 2.3 Hallucination I have been arguing that the reliable indicator component of Goldman’s recent theory adds nothing, that he is better off relying on a pure process view. I must confess, however, that there is one sort of case that indicator reliabilism seems to handle better than process G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 163 reliabilism. To my knowledge, no one has noticed that hallucination poses a problem for process reliabilism, on the grounds that the hallucinatory experience is the result of a dif- ferent process than veridical experience. now, I’m no friend of disjunctivism, but even if we individuate processes entirely internally, so that the existence or not of the external object doesn’t affect the process type, the hallucinatory and veridical experience still have different (psychologically different!) etiologies. The veridical experience starts with sense organ stimulation, while the hallucination originates endogenously. Such endogenously originating perceptual processes are highly unreliable, yet the resulting beliefs  –  the apparently perceptual beliefs that result from convincing hallucinations – are intuitively justified. Indicator reliabilism, of the non‐disjunctivist variety, at least, handles this quite nicely on the plausible assumption that hallucination is relatively rare: a given percept, which is common to hallucination and veridical perception, might still reliably indicate the external object. Hallucination offers a kind of inverse of the barn facade case: process and indicator reliability come apart but this time in different directions. Process reliabilism gets the barn case intuitively right; indicator reliabilism gets the hallucination case intuitively right. Given the choice, I would rather get the “wrong” answer on hallucination than on the barn facades. I think that our intuitive attraction to the claim that hallucination yields justification comes not from the assumption that percepts justify what they reliably indicate, but from the assumption that someone who is experientially just like us is justi- ficationally just like us. This is the assumption that drives the notorious new evil Demon problem for reliabilism. A reliabilist who thinks that de facto or in situ reliability is neces- sary for justification is going to have to deny that demonworlders are justified, thus claim- ing that agents could have the very same experiences that accompany our justified beliefs, though these agents are unjustified in these very same beliefs. Maybe there are ways to render this initially counterintuitive claim less counterintuitive.xv If so, we might be less convinced that hallucinatory experiences are indeed justification‐conferring. Another consideration against hallucination is that it is sometimes, perhaps always, a species of cognitively penetrated perception, and there is independent reason to think that the cognitive penetration of perception frequently destroys the justification normally enjoyed by perceptual belief. If I seem to hear anger in someone’s voice because of some racist prejudice on my part, or I seem to see flirtatious gestures due to wishful thinking, these perceptual beliefs are unjustified. If my fear of spiders causes me to “see” them everywhere I look, my spider beliefs are unjustified. These examples seem to involve unjustified beliefs, even if the resulting experience is identical to a veridical experience of the right sort (lyons 2011). Hallucinations that result from inadvertent drug ingestion or transient brain damage are not obviously, intuitively, unjustified, but perhaps the consideration of hallucination due to wishful thinking and other blatant forms of cognitive penetration should make us diffident about insisting that hallucina- tion must result in justified belief. Finally, recall the role reserved for experiences in section 1.4 above. In standard cases of convincing hallucination, the agent will have available to her a reliable process which would result in a belief with the same content as the one arrived at via hallucinatory experience. She will have available to her, even in hallucinatory situations, an inferential 164 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y process (I’m being appeared to F‐ly; normally when that happens there’s something nearby; therefore, there’s probably something F nearby) that is reliable enough to give her propositional justification for the relevant belief, even if reliabilism implies that it is not justified (that is, that it is not doxastically justified). Perhaps this can account somewhat for the intuition that seems to favor indicator reliabilism over process reliabilism. 3 Ex Ante Justification, Propositional Justification, Evidence, and Defeat In the last section, I argued that the reliabilist understanding of evidence should involve process reliability, not reliable indication. Here I want to work out the details a bit more, in a way I think Goldman should find agreeable. The heart of reliabilism is a theory of prima facie, ex post/doxastic justification. but it also needs to say some- thing about ultima facie justification (prima facie justification that is not defeated), and it would be nice to say something about propositional and ex ante justification. evidentialists hold that these concepts are all tightly linked, with evidence serving as the key that unlocks the others. In this section I want to suggest, in a preliminary way, that Goldman can do with processes all of what the evidentialist does with evidence, and more. Goldman is not very explicit about this, but he seems to equate propositional justifica- tion with ex ante justification (for example, 2008: 77; 2015: 5) and both of these with having evidence in the sense described by the fittingness factor (2011b: 274). He doesn’t say much about defeat in recent works aside from the aforementioned disavowal of ARP. Whatever Goldman’s own position, the simplest view about the relation among these four concepts is that ex ante and propositional justification for p are the same and are simply a matter of having evidence for p, while defeat is a matter of having rebutting or undercut- ting evidence (that is, for being ex ante/propositionally justified in either not‐p or for a proposition to the effect that one’s evidence for p was/is somehow inadequate). Setting defeat temporarily aside and including a generic reliable indicator theory of evidence, we get the following putative equivalences: S is ex ante justified in believing that p ≣ S is propositionally justified in believing that p ≣ S has evidence that p ≣ S is either in a nondoxastic state that state‐indicates p or S is in a (propositionally) justified doxastic state that content‐indicates p. 3.1 Having evidence I have come close to arguing against the last equivalence here, in arguing that indication is neither necessary nor sufficient for conferring evidence. The having evidence relation is distinct from, though obviously closely related to, the conferring evidence relation. If a state doesn’t confer evidence on p, it is not very plausible that being in that state thereby gives someone evidence for p. G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 165 What should Goldman say instead about what it is to have evidence for something? Recall the suggestion from the end of the last section that when S’s belief that p is based on e by way of process R, e is evidence of p for S only if R is reliable. (There are problems with this understanding of evidence, some of which won’t concern us here. xvi) Having evidence should be a matter of being in some mental state that can serve as evidence. Goldman could then say that S has evidence that p at t iff (i) e is a mental state of S’s at t, (ii) there’s a reliable process in S’s cognitive repertoire at t that maps  e to p (that is, produces p as an output in response to e), and (iii) any beliefs contained in e are justified. There’s a lot about this that’s imprecise. For one thing, I haven’t said whether the justification required by (iii) is doxastic or propositional, ex post or ex ante.xvii I also haven’t specified whether e is a conscious or even an occurrent state of S, and perhaps we want the notion of having evidence to be noncommittal on this score. In the case of stored but nonoccurrent memory beliefs, for example, sometimes we want to say that they count as evidence the agent has (in a loose sense of “has”) and sometimes that they don’t (in a stricter sense). Having evidence might even come in degrees, in at least two ways. First, some nonoccurrent states are easier to recall than others; second, two cognitive processes that are both within the cognitive repertoire of the agent (that is, the agent is capable of executing these processes) might differ significantly in availability. For one thing, it is not always obvious that a given process is relevant or appropriate to use on a given occasion; the processes whose relevance is more obvious seem to be in some intuitive sense more available than the others. Another factor is that some processes are more difficult to execute than others; the more difficult processes should perhaps count as less available, hence less relevant to the agent’s evidential status, than the easier processes. These are the sorts of complications that lead Feldman (1988) to the unusual view he endorses about having evidence. It is understandable that he would be more worried about these than a reliabilist, since the reliabilist has an independent account of prima facie (doxastic) justifiedness, while Feldman explicitly understands doxastic justification in terms of proposi- tional justification. It is better if the vagueness and indeterminacy is associated with the sec- ondary target of analysis, rather than the primary target. It would be good for the reliabilist to clarify the having evidence relation, but (a) some epistemological methodologies require that vagueness in the folk concept by matched by vagueness in the analysis, and it is not implausible that our folk concept of having evidence is vague in just these ways; and (b) doing so doesn’t affect the central project of reliabilism: the theory of prima facie, ex post, doxastic justification. There is one addition that I think needs to be made. As discussed earlier in section 2.2, many of the cues involved in normal perception fail to count as part of the agent’s evidence, because the agent is not even tacitly aware of their evidential significance. The auditory system presumably registers the interaural time difference and interaural level difference, and this results in certain mental states of the agent that feed into reliable processes, but these states don’t count as part of the agent’s evidence, in any ordinary sense of the term. Thus, I think we need an additional condition for S’s having evidence that p: (iv) S is at least in a position to detect e and appreciate its relevance vis‐à‐vis the truth of p. “Detect” and “appreciate” are probably epistemic terms here, and that might be trouble for some theories, but neither Goldman nor I think all epistemic properties can be understood in terms of having evidence, so there are no obvious circularity worries. 166 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 3.2 Propositional and ex ante justification Understanding having evidence takes us a ways toward understanding propositional justification. Propositional justification is characterized in different ways by different authors, but the general idea is that it is the kind of justification that attaches to a propo- sition, whether the subject believes that proposition or not; a propositionally justified proposition (or belief) is one that is somehow the right thing for the subject to believe; it is one for which the subject has justification (or a justification), even if the subject does not justifiedly believe it. Presumably, you can be propositionally justified in believing something that you are unjustified (doxastically) in believing. I’m not aware of a canoni- cal statement of propositional justification, but epistemologists seem to know roughly what’s meant.xviii The term “ex ante justification” comes from Goldman (1979), and he has two things to say about it. “[I]f S is trying to decide whether to believe p and asks our advice, we may tell him that he is ‘justified’ in believing it. We do not thereby imply that he has a justified belief, since we know he is still suspending judgment. What we mean, roughly, is that he would or could be justified if he were to believe p” (124). When he comes to offer a theory of ex ante justification, however, Goldman says that “S is ex ante justified in believing p at t if and only if there is a reliable belief‐forming operation available to S which is such that if S applied that operation to his total cognitive state at t, S would believe p at t‐plus‐delta (for a suitably small delta) and that belief would be ex post justified” (124). This latter formulation is quite similar to what I offer above concerning having evidence, though without the explicit reference to evidential states. It is different from the other statement of ex ante justification, quoted above. The first is a counterfactual justifiedness view, while the second is a justification possession view. These can obviously come apart. I can possess a cogent justification for some proposi- tion, even though if I were to believe it, I would believe it for some bad reason. Goldman might have meant for the counterfactual formulation to be a rough and preliminary characterization, to be supplanted by the justification possession formulation, but I think there are two important and distinct concepts here. To keep them straight, I will stipula- tively reserve “ex ante justification” for the counterfactual type of justifiedness (suitably amended, perhaps) and “propositional justification” for some variety of justification possession. If evidentialism is true, having evidence can simply be equated with propositional justification (though not with ex ante justification). This, in fact, is a fairly standard state- ment of evidentialism: S is (propositionally) justified in believing p if, only if, and to the degree that S has evidence for p. Having evidence is usually understood in internalist terms by evidentialists, but an evidentialist reliabilist could use something like the view offered above. Despite his recent embrace of evidence, however, Goldman explicitly denies evidentialism: some beliefs are justified even though the agent has no experiential or doxastic evidence for them (2008, 2009a, 2011a, 2011b). The above view of having evidence yields a theory of propositional justification simply by discarding the last requirement, making having evidence for p sufficient but not necessary for being propo- sitionally justified in believing p (perhaps Goldman never meant to equate the two after all), G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 167 and leaving us with the following: S is propositionally justified in believing that p at t iff (i) e is a mental state of S’s at t, (ii) there’s a reliable process in S’s cognitive repertoire at t that maps e to p (that is, produces p as an output in response to e), and (iii) any beliefs contained in e are justified. Although it drops a requirement that I think is essential to something’s serving as evidence, it shares with evidentialism the view that propositional justification is a matter of the agent’s already having within her everything needed for justification. This last point is well illustrated by a crippling flaw with the simple counterfactual understanding of ex ante justification. I don’t currently know how many pages are in the book on my desk, but were I to form a belief about the book’s page count, I would do so by turning to the last page and reading the number. This is a reliable enough process, but my readiness to use it in counterfactual situations doesn’t make me actually justified – even ex ante – in any belief about the page count, right now, not having looked. If S is ex ante justified now in believing something, this justification must not depend on S’s acquisition, in the counterfactual scenario, of new information, information S does not now possess. The proposed view about propositional justification incorporates this by requiring that S’s mental states and cognitive processes at t be enough to produce doxastic justification, that the process be reliable and able to produce the belief that p, given as inputs only those mental states that S is already in. This may be why Goldman (1979) includes the “if S applied that operation to his total cognitive state at t” clause, but without further restric- tions on what counts as a belief‐forming operation, this fails to guarantee that S receives no new input and thus fails to require that S’s current state is sufficient for justification without that input. Instead of the simple counterfactual theory, then, we should say that S is ex ante justi- fied in believing that p at t if and only if, if S were to come to believe p using only processes that took as inputs mental states S is in at t, then S would be (doxastically) justified in believing p. To be ex ante justified, S would have to have a reliable process in her cognitive repertoire, and thus ex ante justification implies propositional justification, although propositional justification does not imply ex ante justification. nevertheless, there needn’t be any overlap between the processes that put S in a posi- tion to justifiedly believe p and the processes that S would use in coming to believe p, even if we restrict the latter to those that require no new inputs. Suppose you and I share some good evidence for some proposition regarding which we are both currently suspending belief. Suppose further that if we were each to come to believe that proposition, it would be for different reasons: you would believe it because of that evidence, and I would believe it as the result of wishful thinking. you are propositionally and ex ante justified, while I am propositionally justified but not ex ante justified. The ex ante justification seems to make a difference; you are in a better epistemic position than I am, even though we share the same evidence and are equally propositionally justified. earlier I argued that having evidence for p was – if having evidence is understood in indicator reliabilist terms  –  epistemically inert; evidence thus understood does not by itself improve one’s epistemic situation. one could have excellent evidence without being even potentially justified. Propositional justification is less epistemically inert than having a reliable indicator, but the contrast between ex ante and propositional justification 168 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y illustrates how far propositional justification is from the real (doxastic) thing. If one is propositionally justified, then one is in some sense potentially doxastically justified, but it is still a fairly weak sense, for someone could be propositionally justified in believing p, even though she would never believe p for any of the good reasons and only ever believe it for the bad reasons. To be ex ante justified is to be close, roughly speaking, to being doxastically justified; to be propositionally justified is not. one can, of course, be propo- sitionally and ex ante justified at the same time, but the positive epistemic status of ex ante justification should not be illicitly attributed to propositional justification as well. For these reasons, the reliabilist should not give up on the notion of ex ante justifica- tion or attempt to subsume it under propositional justification. I have tried here to distinguish among three related properties: being ex ante justified, being propositionally justified, and having evidence. I have tried to show that they can be understood in process reliabilist terms, without significant concessions to either indicator reliabilism or to evidentialism. The evidence relation is explicated quite well without an indication component but entirely in terms of process reliability and availability. The slight but significant difference between the proposed accounts of having evidence and of prop- ositional justification highlights the role of justification‐conferring processes that do not involve the use of evidence. The distinction between ex ante justification and proposi- tional justification shows that even if one wants to focus on potential, rather than actual justifiedness, there is much of that that has little to do with evidence possession and much to do with psychological propensities. 3.3 Defeat Above, in section 1.3, we saw that Goldman seems to want to do away with the alternative reliable process (ARP) theory of defeat in favor of an evidential account. I made an initial case against such a move, and the recent discussion of propositional justification contrib- utes to this case. Working out the details of ARP would be difficult, to say the least, and I won’t try to do it here. but I think that the problem is endemic to the nature of defeat and has little to do with ARP per se. It is standard to distinguish between evidential and normative defeaters. If you are prima facie justified in believing p but have some reason to believe that not‐p, or that your original reason for believing p was defective, then you have a rebutting or an undercutting defeater (respectively) (Pollock 1986). both of these are evidential defeaters, as they con- sist in one’s having evidence for some proposition that threatens the justification of the original belief. To have a normative defeater, on the other hand, is for it to be the case that there is or was something else or something more you should have done in determining whether or not p. An evidentialist will have to claim that all normative defeaters are in fact a species of evidential defeaters (since ultima facie justification, as well as prima facie justification, is supposed to be entirely a matter of one’s evidence), presumably a species of undercutting defeaters. but then it is not the fact that I didn’t try to think of obvious counterexamples that defeats the justification for my belief in some generalization; it’s the belief that I didn’t try to think of counterexamples (or the evidence I have for that belief). G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 169 It is not hard to see why an externalist would resist the reduction of normative defeaters to evidential defeaters. It seems that Kornblith’s headstrong physicist is unjustified, even if (perhaps partly because) he is too arrogant to hear the objection; and it seems that sloppy reasoning yields unjustified belief, even when we don’t think we’re reasoning sloppily. but if that’s right, if there are irreducibly normative defeaters, then we will need some way to account for them that goes beyond invoking evidential states and relations. ARP offers an obvious way to do this. xix listening to objections and trying to think of counterexamples are reliable and easily available cognitive processes, which, if used in the relevant cases, would have resulted in the agents’ not believing as they did. even where evidential defeaters are concerned, we need a way of understanding the evidence relation, and as argued above, it is doubtful that we can do this without appealing to the cognitive processes available to the agent. Insofar as defeat is a matter of having evidence, and having evidence is a matter of having certain reliable processes available (that is, in one’s cognitive repertoire), our theory of defeat will have to make use of available reliable processes, which were not used but could have been, as alternatives to the ones that were. So ARP, or something very much like it, will loom large in a reliabilist understanding of defeat even where evidential defeat is concerned. In fact, so-called “evidential” defeaters should not be understood in terms of one’s having evidence for a proposition that threatens one’s justification for p, but in terms of one’s being proposi- tionally justified in a proposition that threatens one’s justification for p. Still, ARP or something much like it will be involved. There is a way in which the alternative reliable processes originally envisioned by Goldman involve a deeper commitment than the reliable processes invoked in my view of having evidence, propositional justification, and ex ante justification. The latter are all restricted to processes that take as inputs only those states the agent is already in, while there was no such restriction in the original statement of ARP. An adequate theory of defeat will require some restriction on available processes, though probably not the same restriction as the theories of propositional justification and the rest (viz. to processes that take as inputs only those states the agent is already in). To recall a case mentioned earlier, the doctor’s belief seems to be ultima facie unjustified if there is new counterevidence in a medical jour- nal that is sitting on her desk and which she has had plenty of time to read. The alternative defeating process here is one that does not merely take as inputs the cognizer’s current mental states, and it seems to defeat justification, not just knowledge. on the other hand, if I have excellent reason to think the book on my desk has 256 pages, this belief is not defeated by the fact that if I were to open it and look, I would see that it only has 249. It is far from obvious how one might get both of these cases right at the same time. The easiest, though I  think somewhat unsatisfactory, solution is to simply retain the standard restriction on processes, in essence holding that justification for p is defeated whenever the agent is propo- sitionally justified in something that would, if believed, result in her not believing p. If a more satisfactory solution is more complicated, this is hardly the fault of ARP; it is a fault of the complicated nature of defeat. If anything, it is a virtue of ARP that it can be permuted in whatever ways are necessary to account for these complexities. I won’t try to figure out the details here. The point I’m hoping to make is simply that Goldman shouldn’t abandon ARP in favor of some more evidentialist‐friendly theory of 170 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y defeat. even evidential defeaters are best understood in terms of available reliable processes, and there are more defeaters than just evidential defeaters. 4 Conclusion like Goldman, I think process reliabilism needs to incorporate an evidential element. For this and other reasons, the reliabilist should have a view about the scope and nature of evidence. nevertheless, I think the concessions to evidentialism can be minimized. Rather than allowing that both nonbasic and even some basic beliefs require evidential support, we can hold that only nonbasic beliefs do. While Goldman offers a two‐factor view of evidential justification, I proposed a simplified view that dispenses with the objective fittingness factor, construed as reliable indication, in favor of a process‐centered account. I then tried to show how Goldman could use this process‐centered account as a starting point for treating the sorts of epistemological properties evidentialists have typically focused on, like evidence possession and propositional justification. The reliabilist can go far beyond the standard evidentialist treatments, however, by extending the process‐ centered account to ex ante justification and defeat, which don’t yield readily to eviden- tialist treatment. Again, I am not sure how much of what I have argued here is really incompatible with any of Goldman’s serious commitments. Some of the concessions to evidentialism may have been made for the sake of argument, rather than as substantive pieces of new reliabil- ist doctrine. What I’m doing here is fairly close to defending the old Goldman against the new Goldman. but there is still a great deal of common ground. The new Goldman, the old Goldman, and I all agree that even if reliabilism needs an evidential component, the role of evidence is going to be highly delimited, especially by evidentialist standards, and that the evidential relation will need to be understood in terms of reliability. even if he resists my simplified views of evidence, defeat, and the like, the central element of these views – process reliability – is obviously something for which Goldman has a high regard. xx Notes i Part of it, anyway. A second contribution is discussed later, in section 1.3. In addition, Goldman thinks evidentialism helps reliabilism to make sense of ordinary perception and some kinds of memory beliefs. ii This view is worked out in much more detail in lyons (2009). A belief‐dependent process (Goldman 1979) is one that numbers beliefs among its inputs; a process is belief‐independent otherwise. iii In (2008: 77) he seems to be thinking of nondoxastic evidence as a temporary and provisional concession to the internalist, though in (2011b) and (2011a: 461ff,) he seems to be expressing a stronger commitment to the epistemic role of nondoxastic evidence. even then, he denies in a number of places (2008, 2009a, 2011a, 2011b) that all beliefs require evidence to be justified, and even where evidence is relevant to justification, it may contribute to justification without being strictly necessary for justification (2011a: 463). G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y 171 iv I call this the core conception because they sometimes invoke other mental phenomena, includ- ing unconscious states and even dispositions (Conee and Feldman 2011: 304–5). From their appeal to dispositions, it would seem that the sorts of mental states involved in propositional justification are not necessarily the same as the ones involved in doxastic justification (since it would seem one does not base a belief on a disposition). Furthermore, they sometimes invoke such mental factors as having learned “something about distinguishing sufficiently apt envi- ronments for visual color judgments” (2004: 107). It is clear that “learned” is supposed to be understood nonfactively, but it is not clear whether what is learned is supposed to count as part of the agent’s evidence. If so, it seems to cause trouble for Feldman’s modest foundationalism; if not, the resulting view seems to conflict with the evidentialist claim that any two agents who have the same evidence are equally justified. one sometimes encounters claims to the effect that “one thing is ‘evidence’ for another just in case the first tends to enhance the reasonable- ness or justification of the second” (Kim 1988, which is cited apparently approvingly in Kelly 2006). This claim is hard to take seriously, however, for it conflates evidence with justifiers, or J‐factors (i.e., anything that is relevant to the justificational status of a belief). I doubt even an evidentialist would hold that evidence exhausts the class of J‐factors (the fact that S’s total evidence supports h is a J‐factor but not, on the face of it, part of S’s evidence), and in any case, it cannot be the definitional claim it appears to be without begging the question against the very possibility of nonevidentialist views, or views that hold that evidential relations are contingent. Such views might turn out to be false, but they’re not blatantly incoherent. v This understanding of evidence might rule out acquaintance (Fumerton 2001) as something on which a belief might be based (if I understand acquaintance correctly). Whether this is a problem for the present understanding of evidence is a question that can be ignored for the present purposes. vi Williamson’s famous (2000) claim that evidence = knowledge is presumably a claim about the evidence relation; it is a claim about what can (evidentially) justify what, not a claim about what can be based on what. He presumably does not deny that a belief could be based on a falsehood. Similarly, evidential externalism (Silins 2005) is the view that agents identical with respect to their nonfactive mental states might nevertheless fail to have the “same evidence” due to external facts, such as that one but not the other is hallucinating. one might insist on reading this as a claim about how to individuate the evidence relata, but this strikes me as unhelpful and uninteresting metaphysics unless it is also claimed that the relation differs: that, e.g., veridical experiences can justify beliefs that hallucinations cannot. vii It is easy to come up with further counterexamples. electroception, magnetolocation, ultravi- olet and infrared (heat) vision, echolocation, and the heightened chemosenses of other animals offer a small sampling of actually realized senses which, in some possible organisms, yield justified basic beliefs. If these beliefs require (nondoxastic) evidence, and if evidence essential- ism is true, then these very same sensations would, were they to occur in us, fit with certain of our beliefs. They wouldn’t justify these beliefs for us, however, so if these beliefs are evidentially justified, evidence essentialism is false. A similar argument is pursued in lyons (2013). viii I am not endorsing a general metabelief or doxastic ascent requirement, of course. The existence of some beliefs for which other beliefs were needed never was a good argument for coherentism. ix In Goldman (2009a) he discusses an abandoned project to develop an internalist–externalist hybrid by insisting that the correct J‐rules had internal antecedents (e.g., if you’re appeared to F‐ly, then it is permissible to believe that something F is nearby). Presumably, he abandoned the project in part because of nonevidentially justified beliefs of the sort just mentioned. x one might deny that this is the right understanding of reliable indication, because in this case the evidence doesn’t raise the probability of the target belief, the latter already being 1. Such a response, however, would either preclude using the notion of fit to account for the evidential status of belief in necessary truths, or require some other understanding of fit. 172 G ol DMA n on ev ID en C e A n D   R el IA b I l IT y xi I assume that the evidence relation of concern to us here is an epistemically significant one. Reliable indication might suffice for evidence in some very detached and disembodied sense, but it is insufficient for evidence in some epistemologically significant sense. If the connection between evidence and propositional justification is at all close, then we need an understanding of evidence (or having evidence) that is far less detached. even Conee and Feldman (2008) deny that e’s entailing h makes e evidence of h for S, provided that S is in no position to understand or be aware of the entailment, presumably because it destroys the connection between evidence and propositional justification. S might know e without being at all propositionally justified in believ- ing h. This detached understanding of evidence is popular in the philosophy of science literature but not in epistemology (even, I think, among evidence essentialists). I don’t mean to deny the existence of evidence in this detached sense, although I am not at all sure the notion is coherent, and it is not part of my present concern. Thanks to Tom Senor for clarification on these issues. xii Perhaps, despite Goldman’s suggestive linking of propositional justification and evidential fit- tingness, satisfaction of the fit factor does not imply that anything is being done right; maybe both factors must be satisfied before any positive epistemic status accrues. This would block the inference from “S satisfies the fit factor”to “S is doing something epistemically right.” but this doesn’t work, unless the fit factor plays a very different role from the process reliability factor, for it is clear that one can have a positive epistemic status by satisfying the reliability factor, even if the belief doesn’t fit any evidence. If we can have justified beliefs that aren’t based on any evidence – as Goldman agrees we can  –  then we can achieve justification by satisfying the reliability factor but not the fit factor. xiii Alston (1988) seems to be opting for state indication across the board, on the rationale that doxastic grounds can confer justification only if themselves justified, which means that they will be likely to be true, so whatever a (justified) belief content‐indicates, it will probably state‐indicate as well. This move amounts to forgoing an indicator reliabilist analogue of conditional reliability (Goldman 1979), and the view suffers accordingly. Goldman (2011b) opts for content indication across the board, which commits him to claiming that the justi- fying experiences have contents and even truth values. What I just called the “natural move” still seems natural to me, even if it isn’t especially popular. xiv It would be good to have a detailed theory about the individuation of processes. Though I can neither develop nor defend it here, I think that the best way to go is perhaps largely to hand the problem off to empirical psychology (at least so far as normative epistemology (Goldman 1992) is concerned). Psychology is concerned to state lawful generalizations with as much detail and hence predictive power as possible. If we individuate processes as the narrowest process type describable by the laws of psychology, we will avoid Feldman’s (1985) “no distinction” problem; any variable recognized as relevant by psychology (lighting conditions, attention level, degree of match bet- ween geon description and stored object model, etc.) can figure into process individuation. At the same time, because we are constrained by the laws of psychology, Feldman’s (1985) “single case” problem is likewise avoided, for psychological laws don’t cut things finely enough to rule out all but one case. I think, though this would have to be worked out, that this proposal would also rule out a Comesaña‐style appeal to contents, thus preventing the process/indicator collapse we saw above. xv As I try to do in lyons (2013). xvi In lyons 2009: 167–74, I discuss these problems and sketch my preferred (reliabilist) account of the evidential relation. There, unlike here, I stay neutral between indicator and process reli- abilist accounts of the “appropriate reliability connection” between the ground and the belief it justifies, focusing instead on the other necessary conditions. Roughly, “basic inferences” are those for which reliability suffices, and “nonbasic inferences” are those for which the agent needs a justified belief in the corresponding conditional, and I claim that the cognitive architecture of the organism determines which inferences are basic for that cognizer and which are not. I won’t try to impose all this on Goldman.

As Jack lyons explains, and his readers will already know, he is a proponent of reliabilism, at least some brand of reliabilism. And he is very sympathetic to my kind of reliabilism. So his criticism of me – at least of certain things I say in “Toward a synthesis of reliabilism and evidentialism” – is a matter of detail. He fears that my proposed synthesis concedes too much to evidentialism. After formulating the three most troublesome concessions, he writes: “Reliabilists who have signed a purity pledge won’t like this.” The purity pledge, apparently, is a pledge to uphold the form of reliabilism I had previously championed, which, as lyons tells it, I myself am in danger of violating. As lyons proceeds to explain later in the paper, “What I’m doing here is fairly close to defending the old Goldman against the new Goldman.” The new Goldman is messing things up, evidently, so lyons has come to restore the old order. but hold on there! Am I really departing so much from my old ways? What is the nature of these turncoat concessions of which I stand accused, and is it true that I am now allowing what I previously forebade? Well, lyons’s accusations are carefully hedged; he does not go overboard. He writes: but there is still a great deal of common ground. The new Goldman, the old Goldman, and I all agree that even if reliabilism needs an evidential component, the role of evidence is going to be highly delimited, especially by evidentialist standards, and the evidential relation will need to be understood in terms of reliability. This strikes me as pretty accurate. but I would like to clarify the record further. There may be an impression abroad that I have long rejected any role for evidence (or “reasons,” or “grounds”) in epistemology. but I have never made any such rejection. nor do I concur Reply to Lyons 176 R e P l y T o l y on S with lyons’ evidence‐deflationary comments in which he denies that evidence is an epistemic notion (!). What is true is that I have long been largely silent about the epistemo- logical role of evidence, until recently. However, I did assign to a certain class of mental states a role that comes fairly close to what Feldman and Conee consider evidence. Specifically, I wrote of mental states that serve as inputs to belief‐forming processes. And such input states often (though not invariably) would serve in the role of evidence. This would include justified beliefs that are used as premises in inference and perceptual states used as bases for perceptual beliefs. The sorts of mental states that evidentialists call “evidence” are essentially the same kinds of states that other epistemologists call bases, reasons, or grounds (for belief). They are states such that, if a subject has an appropriate kind of process, she could “operate” on those reasons or bases to produce a justified belief. A reliable process operating on such states would probably, or easily, lead to a true belief. Here’s an illustration. Contrast two visual states with one another. The first is one you would undergo if you were seeing a friend’s living room in full light and other visually normal circumstances. The second state is one you would be in if you were in the same living room (for the first time) but were blindfolded, or “seeing” the room in total darkness. If you applied your normal visual processes (plus a typical assemblage of stored object concepts) to the first state, you would likely form many beliefs – true beliefs – about the room’s furniture and layout. If you embarked on the same exercise applied to the second state, it would probably produce many fewer beliefs, and not many true ones. Why? because the second state is informa- tionally much “thinner” than the second. The first bears far more informational content than the second (where the informational content is in a visual format rather than a propositional one). This shows that mental‐evidential states are genuinely epistemic, in the sense that they have a (potential) epistemic bearing, or impact, on believing truth, avoiding error, and the like. This result cuts against one of lyons’s theses in the present paper: that evidence (in the Conee–Feldman sense) is not an epistemic notion. What I am saying here is not a re‐statement of anything in my “Synthesis” paper. I am not trying to tie evidencehood to reliable indicatorship. The pertinent moral, moreover, bears directly on what lyons refers to as the “new Goldman.” This “new Goldman” is happy to say that we should keep the concept of (mentalistic) evidence in our episte- mological quiver, and deploy it when appropriate. evidential states can be epistemi- cally better or worse, at least relative to specific epistemic ends. but this new Goldman isn’t really so new; the move here by no means violates any principles I put forward in earlier position statements. Indeed, the things (mental states) that qualify here as evi- dence were present – in different terminology, to be sure – as early as “What is justified belief ?” Furthermore, the concept of evidence introduced here cannot be wholly reduced to, or defined in terms of, process reliability. This fact does not reveal me to be a kind of changeling. even in Epistemology and Cognition (a work routinely considered a specimen of reliabilism), I countenanced types of epistemic evaluations not restricted to reliability. They also included (question‐answering) power and speed, where power is the capacity to R e P l y T o l y on S 177 answer a greater number of questions truly (and not simply avoid forming false beliefs about the answers). Does this get us anywhere with propositional justifiedness, or ex ante justifiedness? lyons has made things more difficult with his clever and insightful examples. To me he just shows – what I had long suspected but never managed to formulate – how obscure and problematic is the notion of propositional justifiedness. This is one of many intriguing themes lyons puts forward. Goldman and His Critics, First Edition. Edited by Brian P. McLaughlin and Hilary Kornblith. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. A Naturalistic Approach to the Generality Problemi Erik J. O lss O N 8 1 Introduction Process reliabilism, or reliabilism for short, is the view that S knows that p if and only if (i) p is true, (ii) S believes that p, (iii) S’s belief that p was acquired through a reliable process, and (iv) an appropriate anti‐Gettier condition is satisfied. Reliabilism is sometimes advocated, alternatively, as a theory of epistemic justification, the main idea being that a person is justified in belief that p just in case her belief that p was formed via a reliable process. ii For the purposes of the following discussion, there is no need to make a sharp distinction between these two brands of reliabilism. For definiteness, I will, initially, state much of the discussion in terms of knowledge. The source of the generality problem for reliabilism is the observation that, because a process token is an unrepeatable causal sequence occurring at a particular time and place, it makes no good sense to ask whether a token process is reliable in itself. Rather, what can fundamentally be reliable or not are process types. For instance, the concrete process of Jones’s coming to believe that he won the lottery on May 1, 2007, is itself neither reliable nor unreliable. However, given that its associated type is taken to be “belief formed through reading the local newspaper,” it is (probably) reliable. A process token can still be said to be (un)reliable in a derivative sense if its associated process type is (un)reliable. The problem now arises, more specifically, because each token process can be classified as belonging to a great many different types, and it is not obvious how to single out one of these types rather than another as the unique associated type of the process in question. For example, the process leading up to Jones’s belief could be classified narrowly as belonging to the type whose sole member is Jones’s coming to have his belief about the lottery, or, to take the other extreme, broadly as a belief formed through reading. Furthermore, depending on what type is singled out as special we may get different verdicts as regards the reliability of the process in question. Given the narrow classification A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 179 in terms of the type whose sole member is the process producing Jones’s belief, that process will, if the belief is true, be reliable. If it is seen instead as instantiating the general type “reading,” it might be judged unreliable. Reading in general, irrespective of what is being read, is probably not reliable to an extent that suffices for knowledge. These considerations reveal what appears to be an unacceptable lacuna in the reliabilist account of knowledge. From the reliabilist’s perspective, whether a person knows or not will in many cases depend on whether the type of process producing the belief in question is reliable. And yet, as most commentators would agree, reliabilists have generally failed to clearly identify the type pertaining to a given token. In the absence of a principled account for how to select the relevant type, the reliabilist theory appears to be, in conee and Feldman’s words, “radically incomplete” (1998: 3).iii Feldman (1985) and conee and Feldman (1998) cite a number of criteria they think any acceptable solution should satisfy, beyond associating every process token with a corresponding process type.iv According to Feldman, solving the generality problem for reliabilism requires showing how to avoid what he calls the single case and no distinction problems. The single case problem occurs when a process type is described so narrowly that only one instance of it ever occurs, and hence the type is either completely reliable or completely unreliable depending on whether the belief is true or false. The no distinction problem arises when beliefs of obviously different epistemic status are produced by tokens that are of the same (broad) relevant type. These two limiting cases were illustrated above in our example with Jones’s belief about the lottery. conee and Feldman lay down three additional requirements for a solution to the generality problem. First, a solution must be “principled” in the sense of not being made on an ad hoc basis. Second, the rule must make reasonable epistemic classifications, by which is meant that the types identified must have a reliability that is plausibly correlated with the justificational status of the beliefs in question. Third, a solution must remain true to the spirit of the reliabilist approach and not characterize the relevant type of process in epistemic terms that are alien to reliabilist theorizing. v Reliabilists have not been insensitive to this problematic which was identified, for example, by Alvin Goldman in his classic 1979 paper and is portrayed as a serious issue for reliabilism in Goldman (1986 and 2008). It is now considered to be a main challenge for a reliabilist theory by reliabilists and their critics alike. vi Goldman has given various cues for how he would like to address this problem but it is my understanding that he has not yet converged on a specific solution, and in Goldman (2008) he expresses dissatisfaction with the approach defended in his earlier work: Which repeatable type should be selected for purposes of assigning a determinate relia- bility number to the process token? “What Is Justified belief ?” does not resolve this ques- tion, and it remains an important one. Goldman (1979) says that cognitive processes should be restricted in “extent” to events within the organism’s nervous system (although he does not abide by this restriction in some of his own illustrations of process types). but this restriction provides no criterion for pinpointing a unique process type. It appears, however, that a determinate reliability number cannot be assigned to a process token unless a unique type is selected.vii I have found no reason to disagree with this self‐critical assessment of Goldman’s. In the same overview of reliabilism, Goldman goes on to discuss several proposals by other authors in an open‐minded spirit, for example, that advanced by beebe (2004). In this paper I will identify, in section 2, what is in my view the main challenge for reliabilism in relation to the typing of belief‐forming processes. This challenge was raised by conee and Feldman in their 1998 article. I will then proceed, in section 3 and onwards, to undermine that challenge by drawing on insights in cognitive science in a way that should make this response attractive to practitioners of naturalized epistemol- ogy, including Goldman himself.viii Nevertheless, Goldman has, in our private corre- spondence, offered a number of interesting objections to what I am about to propose. In section 4, I address what I take to be his main worries, including what he terms his “principal objection”. 2 Conee and Feldman’s Main Challenge Suppose that the critic is correct in thinking (A) that there are generally many different ways of classifying a belief formation process, and (b) that depending on how the process is classified we will get different verdicts as to whether or not the process was reliable. let us finally also grant (c) that the reliabilist has so far been unable to devise an explicit rule by means of which the right type can be identified in a given case. In what sense would these be disturbing facts for the reliabilist? conee and Feldman’s answer, of course, is that these facts together turn reliabilism into a “radically incomplete” epistemological theory. but what, exactly, is the reasoning leading up to this conclusion? extracting a clear answer to this question from conee and Feldman’s work turns out to be surprisingly difficult. Perhaps conee and Feldman are taking reliabilism to provide not merely a conceptual analysis of knowledge or justification but also a normative method for deciding, in prac- tice, whether someone knows or is justified. There are some indications in this direction in their 1998 paper, in which they write, for instance, that “[o]nly when a bearer of relia- bility has been identified does the theory have any implications about the justification of beliefs in particular cases” (3). From this point of view, their criticism is relatively easy to appreciate: reliabilism is radically incomplete because it fails to give a method for identi- fying a process type “in particular cases.” However, this interpretation of conee and Feldman renders their criticism largely uninteresting for the simple reason that reliabi- lism is usually not advanced as a decision method along these lines, and in his 1985 paper Feldman himself explicitly distances himself from this understanding of reliabilism and the generality problem, writing “I do not assume that an acceptable solution to The Problem of Generality must provide a practical and useful method for identifying rele- vant types” (173: footnote 6). There is another, perhaps deeper, reason why this rendering of the generality problem is dubious. critics of reliabilism universally present the generality problem as a challenge exclu- sively facing that particular theory. It is supposed to tell against reliabilism in a way that should make us more favorably disposed toward its main competitors, for example, variants of JTb (justified true belief), virtue theory or, in conee and Feldman’s case, evidentialism. This can 180 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 181 be so only if there is no corresponding problem arising for those other well‐established analyses of knowledge. but if the complaint is that reliabilism does not provide a method for deciding in practice whether someone knows, then it is doubtful whether its critics have indeed suc- ceeded in identifying a problem unique to reliabilism. After all, JTb analyses of knowledge, for example, do not provide such a method because they typically do not provide a method for deciding, in particular cases, whether someone is justified in her belief. by the same token, comesaña (2006) identifies a problem for evidentialism analogous to the generality problem for reliabilism. Providing, in Feldman’s words, practical and useful methods of that kind is an interesting task in its own right but one that is orthogonal to the problem of providing a con- ceptual analysis of knowledge or justification and – returning to the main point – one that concerns just about any account of those concepts that readily comes to mind. ix The upshot is that to the extent that conee and Feldman’s attack on reliabilism rests on a failure to appreciate the two points just made, it can be dismissed by reliabilist as not seriously threatening their position. However, there are other elements of conee and Feldman’s critique that cannot be so readily dismissed. Their 1998 paper contains an ingenious argument that directly targets the reliabilist theory, in so far as its practitioners attempt to capture, at least approxi- mately, the folk concepts of knowledge and justification (and, to be fair, most of us do). The most stimulating part of conee and Feldman’s attack can charitably be viewed as targeting the notion that the reliabilist concepts of knowledge and justification are suffi- ciently similar to their folk counterparts.x let us focus for simplicity on the reliabilist theory of justification (RJ) and on conee and Feldman’s criticism as targeting the faithfulness of RJ with regard to our everyday concept of justification. RJ can fail in this regard in two main ways: in being either too broad or too narrow. RJ is too broad if beliefs can be produced by reliable processes without being justi- fied. It is too narrow if beliefs can be justified without being produced by reliable processes. As for the latter case, suppose there are clear cases of justification, that is, cases where we would all agree that a subject S is justified in believing that p. Imagine, for instance, that we are presented with a picture of Wilma standing in front of a tree in broad daylight. Wilma is, we conclude, looking at the tree. There is nothing obscuring her view, we have no reason to think she is blind, and so on. clearly we would then all assent to Wilma’s being justified in believing that there is a tree in front of her. This is a clear case of justi- fication. but is it also a clear case of belief acquisition through a reliable process? Given claims (A) – (c) above one might be led to think that it is not: given that there are many different ways to classify Wilma’s belief formation process, leading possibly to widely dif- ferent reliability assessments, and given that we have no explicit rule that we can appeal to in the selection of one classification rather than another, it would seem that Wilma’s is not a clear case of reliable belief formation. Rather, it will be, in a sense, indeterminate whether or not Wilma’s belief was reliably formed. This is indeed what certain theoretical considerations in the form of (A) – (c) suggest. but why should we rest content with theory when we can study what happens in practice? Here is a sketch of a proposal for how the matter could be tested experimentally: The proposal involves two groups of subjects confronted with, say, twenty episodes of ordinary life involving a person coming to believe something for some reason or other 182 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M (like Wilma above). For instance, the episodes could be presented to the subjects as film sequences.xi each subject in one of the groups is asked to state independently for each episode shown whether the person figuring in that episode is justified in her belief. let us refer to this group as the justification group, or the J‐group for short. each subject in the other group is asked to state independently for each episode shown whether the person figuring in that episode acquired her belief in a reliable way. let us refer to this group as the reliability group, or R‐group for short. obviously, the instructions for the subjects participating in this experiment should not contain any linguistic hints that may make them favor one classification rather than another. xii Assume now that this experiment has been carried out and that we got a good positive match between the reports of the J‐group and the reports of the R‐group. In other words, more or less the same episodes are described, by all or almost all members of the J‐group, as involving justification and by all or almost all members of the R‐group as involving reliable belief acquisition. That would be clear evidence in favor of the reliabilist theory of justification with regard to its similarity to our everyday concept of justification. What outcome would disconfirm that aspect of the reliabilist theory of justification? If we were to carry out the same experiments only to find there to be little or no positive correlation between judgments of justification and judgments of reliability that would be an unfortunate fact for the reliabilist theory, as it would suggest that the reliabilist concept of justification lacks sufficient similarity to the folk concept of justification. xiii For the purposes of the following discussion we need to distinguish between two kinds of disconfirmation of RJ. We would have a clear case of disconfirmation if, for instance, whenever all or almost all members of the J‐group agreed that the person in the episode is justified, all or almost all members of the R‐group agreed that the person did not acquire her belief in a reliable fashion. let us refer to this as category I disconfirmation. but we could also encounter an outcome in which all or almost all members of the J‐group agree in their justification assessments but in which there is strong dissonance among the members of the R‐group concerning reliability. For instance, some members of the R‐ group may insist that the process was reliable, others may be equally convinced that it was unreliable and still others may fail to reach a verdict at all. let us refer to this case as one of category II disconfirmation. let us ponder the likelihood of various alternative scenarios. As I construe them, conee and Feldman report some rather strong views on this matter, to the effect that whereas the subjects in the J‐group will, at least in paradigmatic cases, tend to give the same reports, the subjects in the R‐group are likely to give widely unsystematic responses. In other words, conee and Feldman predict that the experiment will result in category II disconfirmation of RJ. Why do conee and Feldman predict that the subjects in the J‐group will tend to give the same reports in paradigmatic cases? In our experiment, the episodes displayed to the participating subjects may be selected so as to exemplify what conee and Feldman call “typical contexts in which knowledge and justification claims have clear truth value” (1997: 24). conee and Feldman are committed to there being such contexts, and we must interpret them to be assuming that people will give more or less identical reports when asked whether knowledge or justification is present in those contexts. A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 183 conee and Feldman’s argument for thinking that the subjects in the R‐group will fail to give converging reports is more subtle. Here is a step‐by‐step reconstruction: (cF1) People sometimes agree on typing and reliability but this happens only if the given type they converge upon is salient in the conversational context. (cF2) The only way in which a type may be become salient in a conversational context is by means of linguistic presentation. (cF3) ordinarily, no type is linguistically presented. (cF4) Hence, ordinarily, no type is salient and so people will disagree on typing and reliability. xiv This train of thought applies to our experiment because we were careful to assume that no type is linguistically indicated in the instructions to the participating subjects. Hence, conee and Feldman offer the predication that the subjects in the R‐group will be unable to converge on the same reliability assessment in concrete cases and that this failure is due to the lack of salient types. For instance, the number of R‐group subjects reporting Wilma’s belief formation process to be reliable may be roughly the same as the number of subjects reporting it to be unreliable. My own prediction differs significantly from conee and Feldman’s. I anticipate that both groups will report in a homogeneous manner, and there will be significant positive correlation between the reports of the two groups. For instance, most subjects in both groups will think of Wilma as simply “seeing a tree,” and this will make most subjects in the J‐group report that Wilma is justified in her belief about the tree, and most subjects in the R‐group report that the process by means of which Wilma formed her belief is reli- able. I will proceed now to add substance to these claims. 3 Conee and Feldman’s Challenge Undermined one reason why we should expect people to give the same reliability verdicts in concrete cases comes from our ordinary life experience, for we often agree, it seems, about what is reliable and not, even in the complete absence of linguistic classificatory pointers. If someone comes forward claiming that this car is reliable, pointing to a new Mercedes benz, you would presumably tend to agree that it is. Similarly, we agree that the process by means of which the heart pumps blood through our veins is reliable (if, tragically, only up to a point). or suppose that we discover Karen sitting in the university library reading the encyclopedia britannica. Karen now raises her head saying, “The way I just learned the molecular structure of gold is reliable.” Few of us would be inclined to object. There is another reason for expecting that people should tend to converge on matters of reliability even if no relevant type‐classification is made salient by linguistic means, for this is what influential empirically based work in cognitive psychology strongly suggests. In underpinning this claim I will draw on work on salience and so‐called basic‐level effects in the literature on categorization. 184 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M Several psychological studies have been conducted on how people classify events and, in particular, what it is that makes some event categories more natural or salient than others. This work is relevant here because belief‐forming processes are kinds of events. Zacks and Tversky (2001) is a useful overview of the following and other advances in the psychological literature on event categorization. one line of research in this area indicates that what event type becomes salient may depend on the timescale. consider “crossing the street,” “walking to school,” and “getting an education” as three different types corre- sponding to the same token event. According to the findings, event types corresponding to a medium range timescale, such as “walking to school” are more likely to be salient than other more extreme types. This effect does not depend in any way on one or more types being made salient by linguistic means. Here is an even more suggestive piece of evidence: According to one influential theory recognizing an event as an instance of a category consists of (A) matching it to a schema stored in memory and (b) matching features of the world to variables in the schema. example of a schemata might be “X walks to y,” “X robs y,” and so on. Some schemata may be of evolutionary origin, others are developed in a social context through a learning process. The crucial point is that an event type may become salient because it matches and activates a schema stored in memory. This phenomenon, too, occurs even if no type is singled out linguistically. This is not the place to go into the details of how these phenomena transpire. What can be said with some confidence is that there is a general tendency in the relevant part of cognitive psychology to regard with suspicion any theory  –  such as that advocated by conee and Feldman – according to which a type can become salient in a given context only through being explicitly mentioned. So far we have seen some evidence for thinking that non‐linguistic factors can have salience‐making powers. Such evidence does not by itself indicate that we should expect people to converge in their categorization of events of belief acquisition, for presumably most theories of salience, including those highlighting the role of non‐linguistic mecha- nisms, will involve criteria that are too liberal to pick out unique categories. Suppose, for example, that we have roughly the same structured process schemata stored in memory and that they serve to narrow down the psychologically real categories, in any given con- text, to just a few especially prominent ones. little would prevent a given token process from potentially activating more than one such schema. For instance, Smith’s seeing a tree could conceivably activate the following schemata all of which have some claim to psycho- logical reality: X perceives Y, X sees Y, X sees Y in bright sunlight. What is it, then, that makes us zoom in, eventually, on, say, X sees Y? The foregoing remarks raise the question as to how people can come to agree on a natural classificatory level in taxonomies of salient types. The starting point from which we will gradually approach an answer to that question will be object, rather than event, categorization. consider the taxonomy in Figure 8.1. experimental studies of taxonomies as the one in Figure 8.1 have established that there is a level of categorization that is “basic” in the sense of being most natural. Thus, people will tend to think of things in terms of middle range categories like Table, Lamp and Chair rather than in terms of superordinate (Furniture) or subordinate (Kitchen chair etc.) A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 185 categories. evidence for a basic middle level comes from a variety of experimental sources: basic‐level categories tend to be named when people are shown an object; in recognition tasks, people recognize basic‐level objects faster than either subordinates or superordi- nates; basic‐level names generally have arisen earlier in the development of languages; basic categories are used earlier in the naming and other behavior of young children; finally, basic‐level names tend to be shorter and more frequently used than names of superordinate or subordinate categories. The standard explanation of these basic‐level effects, which “are among the best known and most robust phenomena in the study of human categorization,” xv is based on the observation that categories tend to be associated with “attributes” which are things that can be inferred (in a defeasible sense) from membership in the category. For example, if a thing is classified as a Chair, we can infer that we can sit on it. If it classified as a Lamp, we can infer that it can be lit, and so on. Rosch et al. (1976), which is likely to be the single most important contribution to this area of research, lists the following culturally signifi- cant attributes of furniture categories: Furniture: no attributes Chair: legs, seat, back, arms, comfortable, four legs, wood, holds people – you can sit on it Kitchen chair: no additional Living room chair: large, soft, cushion (additional attributes). Thus, given that something is a chair, it can be inferred that the thing has legs, a seat, and so on. Given that something is a kitchen chair, the same inferences can be made and no new inferences are added. From the categorization of something simply as a piece of furniture, no useful conclusion can be drawn. We can now explain the basic‐level effect by invoking two cognitive mechanisms assumed to be universally operative in human categorization. one mechanism favors economy of representation and the other usefulness (informativity) of the resulting categories. We can conveniently speak of these mechanisms as representing two cogni- tive goals. The goal of economy requires that the classifier treat as many things as possible as “equivalent,” that is, as belonging to the same category. This goal will tend to favor broad categories. The goal of usefulness requires that the classifier seek a maximally useful classification of a given thing. A classification is useful to the extent that interesting attributes of the object can be inferred (again defeasibly) from category Furniture Table Lamp Chair Kitchen table Floor lamp Kitchen chair Dining room table Desk lamp Living room chair Figure 8.1 Taxonomy for furniture. 186 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M membership alone. This goal will tend to favor narrow categories.xvi The challenge facing a classifying subject is to make a reasonable trade‐off between these two goals, that is, to choose a type that is informative and yet cognitively parsimonious. Rosch and her associates proposed a specific way of striking the right balance: the basic classificatory level, they wrote, is “the most inclusive level in a taxonomy at which a clus- ter of attributes, believed to be common to the class named, would be listed” (Rosch et al. 1976: 435–6, original emphasis removed). let us refer to this rule for identifying the basic level as the Rosch rule. For instance, the Chair level is the basic level because it involves a cluster of attributes which are not listed at higher levels in the taxonomy. The Kitchen chair level is not basic because, although it too involves a cluster of listed attributes, those attributes are listed at the higher Chair level as well.xvii,xviii I will now propose to treat the classification of belief‐forming processes in an anal- ogous fashion. The proposal is to use the Rosch rule to determine the type for a given process token just as we did for concrete objects. This is in line with the observation of basic‐level effects in the categorization of events (of which belief formation pro- cesses are a special case) and the claim made by Rosch and her colleagues that the principle of category formation is universally valid. The two cognitive goals previ- ously alluded to are operative in the categorization of belief formation processes, so that our natural inclination is to obtain a categorization that is both economical and informative, just as before.xix The most basic level in a process taxonomy is the most inclusive level at which a cluster of attributes, believed to be common to the class named, would be listed. The example in Figure 8.2 illustrates how this is supposed to work. I hypothesize that the following attributes would be considered to be of potential importance for most people: Perceiving: no attributes Seeing: reliable (for most practical purposes), believing, proximity to object, nothing (opaque) obstructing the view Seeing clearly: very reliable (for scientific/legal purposes) xx Seeing less than clearly: no additional. xxi The basic level is given by the most inclusive level classification of visual perception at which a cluster of attributes are listed, which in this case is the level of Seeing. Perceiving Hearing Feeling Seeing Hearing clearly Feeling clearly Seeing clearly Hearing less than clearly Feeling less than clearly Seeing less than clearly Figure 8.2 A hypothetical taxonomy for belief formation. A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 187 The account we have given of type convergence also predicts convergence in matters of reliability. For the reasons given, people will tend to categorize belief for- mation processes in terms of Seeing, Hearing, and so on. They will then tend to infer the attributes associated with those categories. let us return to the previous example of Wilma for a concrete illustration. I claimed that most of the subjects in the R‐group would think of her as simply “seeing a tree,” a process they will report to be reliable (at least for everyday purposes). The reason is that Seeing is very plausibly a basic‐level event category and Tree a basic‐level object category.xxii either category allows many inferences to be drawn to potentially useful attributes. combining these categories into “seeing a tree” is a cognitively attractive move because it results in a description that is compact yet loaded with information content. Someone might object to our explanation of typing convergence on the following basis: Fine, maybe this succeeds in showing, at least in outline, how we can agree on a process classification and reliability in some cases, but these cases do not seem to correspond to those that epistemologists take special interest in. Some of the “attributes” of Seeing – like “proximity to the object” – are not really epistemically interesting, which raises the ques- tion why we should base our classifications on them. In epistemic contexts, what we care about is simply the reliability of the process, and that is all there is to it. What is needed is an argument as to why we tend to agree on classification/reliability when the reliability only is at stake. The Rosch‐based theory presented here doesn’t seem to do that job, or so the argument goes. So far we have assumed that we are interested in a multi‐purpose clas- sification where many attributes are (potentially) important.xxiii What the objector points out, correctly, is that the original classificatory problem can also be understood as one of single‐purpose classification. on this interpretation, there is only one attribute/property that we care about: reliability. So what happens in this case? The original Rosch rule for multi‐purpose classification, we recall, states that the basic level of classification is the most inclusive level in a taxonomy at which a cluster of attributes, believed to be common to the class named, would be listed. This suggests that, in the single‐purpose case, the basic level of classification should be the most inclusive level in a taxonomy at which the attribute of interest would be listed. There is however an immediate problem with this proposal. Suppose the taxonomy consists of the superordinate Being deceived and the subordinates Being deceived intention- ally and Being deceived unintentionally, and that the token process in question is a case of, say, intentional deception. Since “reliable” is not an attribute of any category to which the token process belongs, there is no level in the taxonomy at which “reliable” is listed. Hence, no type is singled out by our proposed rule. The problem is quickly solved by adding that the relevant taxonomic levels should be such that either the attribute itself or its negation is listed. In other words, the basic level of classification, in the single‐purpose case, is the most inclusive level in a taxonomy at which the attribute or its negation would be listed. This solves the problem: since all the categories to which the token process belongs will be associated with the attribute “unreliable,” the rule will single out a unique type namely Being deceived. That 188 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M category is the most inclusive type to which the token belongs and which is such that the attribute of interest, or – as in this case – its negation, is listed. To take another example, the following attribute list would be relevant if the task is single‐purpose categorization with respect to reliability (for most practical purposes): Perceiving: no attributes Seeing: reliable (for most practical purposes) Seeing clearly: no additional Seeing less than clearly: no additional. If, as we assume, the process was a case not only of Seeing but also of Seeing clearly, both these categories satisfy the condition that “reliable (for most practical purposes)” is listed. However, Seeing is the most inclusive category satisfying that condition, which is why it is singled out by the single‐purpose Rosch rule as the type of the pro- cess in question.xxiv 4 Typing in Non‐Monotonic Taxonomies: A Response to Goldman’s Principal Objection So far we have been looking at taxonomies that are monotonic in the sense that subordinate categories “inherit” all attributes from their superordinates.xxv In the furniture case, for instance, the Chair attribute “has a seat” was supposed to be inherited by the subordinate categories of Kitchen chair and Living room chair. likewise, the reliability attribute of Seeing was assumed to be inherited by its sub- ordinate categories. Monotonic taxonomies admit a highly compressed cognitive representation which allows us to store attributes only once without having to repeat them for subordinate categories. For that reason, we should expect the human mind to favor storing information in monotonic taxonomies if that is an option. We have  provided an account of process typing that should make us confident that people will often converge on the same type for monotonic taxonomies. but what about the non‐monotonic case? consider the following example from Goldman (personal communication): Suppose that John’s process leading up to his belief that the person over there is Susan instantiates the type Seeing. This does not prevent it from also instantiating the type Occluded seeing, by which is meant that the target of vision is at least partly occluded. If classified as Seeing, the process can be inferred to be reliable (for everyday purposes), whereas Occluded seeing will be associated with the attribute “unreliable.” The matter doesn’t end here: sup- pose that in the case we are discussing, the occlusion only pertains to the target’s periph- ery, and furthermore that the occlusion only blocks S’s view of Susan’s body, without blocking the view of her face. let us call this a case of Insignificantly occluded seeing. If the process is typed as Insignificantly occluded seeing, we may once more infer reliability. And so things could continue.xxvi A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 189 If we focus on the single‐purpose classificatory task, the attribute of reliability/unreliability would be assigned as follows: Seeing: reliable Occluded seeing: unreliable Insignificantly occluded seeing: reliable Significantly occluded seeing: unreliable. one can imagine how a taxonomy like the one in Figure 8.3 could be generated “on the fly,” as in the following dialogue: John: I know Susan is over there. I see her. Mary: How can you be sure given the occlusion? John: True, but I see her face so the occlusion is insignificant. xxvii logically speaking, nothing prevents ever more fine‐grained types from being proposed endlessly, but that would surely be quite unrealistic in practice. Rather, we would expect the process of generating types on the fly soon to come to an end. At that point, there are a finite number of types “on the table” forming a taxonomy of types. The question then is: Is there a basic level even if the taxonomy is non‐monotonic and, if so, what character- izes that level? The Rosch rule for single‐purpose categorization, as I have construed it, states that the basic level is the most inclusive level in the taxonomy at which reliability or unreli- ability would be listed. If the occlusion was in fact insignificant, this means that the Rosch rule singles out the category of Seeing as the basic‐level category, from which we may infer that the process was, as we would have expected it to be, reliable. The problem is that the Rosch rule gives exactly the same result if we assume instead that the process was one of significantly occluded seeing. In that case, too, we get the result that Seeing is the basic‐level category so that the process was reliable, which is simply incorrect. Thus, while the Rosch rule for single‐purpose categorization is plausible for monotonic taxonomies, it fails to account for basic‐level effects in the presence of non‐monotonicity. Seeing Occluded seeing Clear seeing Significantly occluded seeing … Insignificantly occluded seeing … Figure 8.3 A hypothetical non‐monotonic taxonomy. 190 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M An alternative suggestion comes to mind: to focus initially on categories to which the process belongs that cannot be further subdivided in ways that would make a difference to what can be inferred about the reliability or unreliability of the process in question; and, further, to choose among the candidates that remain the category that is most inclusive. Suppose again that the occlusion was insignificant, which means that the token process belongs to three categories: Seeing, Occluded seeing and Insignificantly occluded seeing. only the latter cannot be further subdivided in a way that is relevant to reliability, which means that it will be singled out as the process type, enabling us to infer that the process was reliable. by the same token, if the occlusion was significant, the process will be typed as Significantly occluded seeing, from which we may infer that it was unreliable.xxviii unfortunately, as Goldman has pointed out to me (personal communication) this out- come is problematic because the selected categories will, as the example illustrates, be more specific than the expected commonsense categories, that is, Seeing, Hearing etc. Another way of putting it is that the proposal is difficult to justify from a Roschian per- spective. Here is why: As we recall, two cognitive goals are taken within that framework to be universally operative in human cognition: the goal of economy and that of usefulness. It could be argued that, while the present proposal may be justifiable from the point of view of usefulness, it does not do justice to the goal of cognitive economy. let us focus on the latter point. As we saw, a process that is a case of insignificantly occluded seeing is assigned the type Insignificantly occluded seeing by the proposed rule. based on that clas- sification, it can be inferred that the process was reliable. but the same inference could have been made given a coarser and therefore more economical typing of the process as Seeing. Similarly, a process that is a case of significantly occluded seeing is assigned the type Significantly occluded seeing, which allows an inference to unreliability. once more, the same inference could also have been drawn by more economical means by typing the process as Occluded seeing. The proposed rule is, for these reasons, clearly sub‐optimal from the standpoint of the two cognitive forces. In response to this concern, which Goldman has described in our personal corre- spondence as his “principal objection” to the present approach, I will propose an amended rule that improves on the previous proposal, drawing on the insights we just acquired as to why the latter sometimes gives suspect results. let us say that the single‐ purpose category for token process t for taxonomy T (with respect to reliability) is the most inclusive T‐category c such that (i) t belongs to c and (ii) c is associated with the same reliability attribute (reliable/unreliable) as is the most specific T‐category to which t belongs. In other words, we first check what can be inferred regarding reliability from the most specific correct categorization of a given token process in the taxonomy and then identify the most inclusive superordinate from which that same inference can be drawn. As can easily be checked, the amended rule will fare better than the previous proposal with respect to economy, without any informational loss being incurred, because it will type insignificantly occluded seeing as Seeing and significantly occluded seeing as Occluded seeing. I take it that this modified rule thereby also answers Goldman’s principal objection. For monotonic taxonomies this modified rule gives the same result as the original Rosch rule. A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 191 5 Discussion and Conclusion This completes my account of why we should, from the standpoint of cognitive science, expect people to agree to a significant extent in their typing of belief‐forming processes and why, as a result, they should also agree on the resulting reliability verdict. My aim has not been to provide a complete psychological story for why convergence should be expected. I believe, however, that what has been said suffices for the purposes at hand: to shift the burden of proof to conee and Feldman, who, as we recall, predict massive cate- gory II disagreement on reliability in the absence of linguistic guidance, a contention for which they offer little or no evidence beside their own pre‐systematic intuitions. Hence, I take the present account to be a sufficient response to the generality problem as an objec- tion that specifically targets reliabilism. To recapitulate, the reasons provided by conee and Feldman for thinking that the reliabilist analyses of knowledge and justification lack sufficient similarity to the corre- sponding everyday concepts could be neutralized by reference to influential work in cog- nitive psychology. In fact, the way in which cognitive psychology sheds light on this problem is surprisingly consonant with conee and Feldman’s own thinking about the criteria that an acceptable solution to the generality problem should satisfy. Typing takes place in a cognitive environment featuring two contradictory cognitive forces of economy and usefulness. In an effort to mediate between them, the cognitive subject will select a category that is reasonably economical while preserving as much potentially useful infor- mation as possible. The result will be a middle range category. This indicates not only that the present account succeeds in avoiding the single case and no distinction problems; it also accords with the condition that an acceptable account should be “principled.” Furthermore, the solution clearly meets conee and Feldman’s further criterion of being in the spirit of reliabilism, especially as the latter is advanced by practitioners of natural- ized epistemology. What about the remaining criterion stressed by conee and Feldman – that the types identified must have a reliability that is plausibly correlated with the justificational status of the beliefs in question? I see no reason to think that this condition should not be satisfied as well. The present theory predicts that people will normally type processes, even in the absence of linguistic hints, as Seeing, Hearing etc. It should be expected that the perceived reliability of these processes will be strongly correlated with the perceived degree of justification of the resulting beliefs. In fact, recent experiments carried out by my colleague Martin l. Jönsson along the lines described in section 2 amply support this prediction (Jönsson 2013). xxix Jönsson found there to be significant agreement among the folk about how to type belief‐forming processes. For some stimuli, the agreement was even 100 percent. He also discovered there to be a strong correlation between the perceived degree of reliability and the perceived degree of justification.xxx For the purposes of neutralizing conee and Feldman’s central challenge it was suffi- cient to give a purely descriptive account of how people type belief‐forming processes. To be sure, such an account does not give us a method for selecting the normatively correct type in a given case. A normative method of this kind would indeed be a good thing to have, especially in cases in which there are conflicting views about how a given process 192 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M should best be typed, although it is worth repeating that it is no targeted objection to reliabilism to point out that such a method remains to be identified. A further thought is that the Rosch theory may actually turn out to be helpful in this connection as providing a theoretical framework within which a normative account could be developed, perhaps by epistemologists and cognitive scientists in collaboration. As we saw, finally, Goldman’s principal objection prompted me to think more carefully about the non‐monotonic case, which in turn led up to a slightly revised account of the Rosch rule for categorization which, in my view, solves the problem in conformity with the most entrenched parts of the Rosch theory. The result is a response to the only version of the generality problem I am aware of that should prompt the reliabilist’s serious atten- tion, a response which Goldman could presumably adopt without sacrificing any essential part of his epistemological framework. Notes i The present article is a contribution to the research project Knowledge and Reliability funded by the Swedish Research council. Many people have commented on various versions of it, and I am grateful to all of them for their input. They will know who they are. I have also benefited from the criticism of various seminar and conference audiences, including the participants in the lund research seminar in theoretical philosophy and the members of the copenhagen‐ based SeRG research group, headed by Klemens Kappel. I am above all deeply grateful to Alvin Goldman for generously sharing his insights on epistemology in general, and reliabilism in particular, on many occasions over the years we have known each other; for commenting exten- sively on my previous attempts to come to grips with the generality problem, which massively helped me in sharpening my thinking; and, finally, for allowing me to draw on these personal correspondences when writing this paper. ii The process reliabilist account of knowledge was originally formulated by Ramsey (1931). See olsson (2004) for a discussion. For a modern (post‐Gettier) account, see Goldman (1986). The process reliabilist theory of justification was first put forward in Goldman (1979). iii The generality problem is of course not the only problem facing reliabilism. There is also, for instance, the value problem: the problem of explaining how reliabilist knowledge can be more valuable than mere true belief. I have had the privilege of writing a joint paper with Goldman on that topic (Goldman and olsson 2009), in which we propose several alternative, though compatible and possibly complementary, solutions. I have developed and defended my own preferred approach in other places, e.g. olsson (2007, 2009, 2011), and olsson and Jönsson (2011). iv The generality problem is usually stated as one of finding a unique relevant process type for each process token. logically speaking, however, it would suffice to identify, for each token, a class of types whose members are either all reliable or all unreliable. Nevertheless, I will follow the mainstream and assume that the problem is to find a unique type for each token. v A proposal referring to natural kinds is made in Alston (1995). Mark Heller (1995) offers a contextualist approach. For other perspectives, see brandom (1998), Adler and levin (2002), Wunderlich (2003), comesaña (2006) and Kappel (2006). vi The generality objection can be found in many surveys of contemporary epistemology, e.g., Hetherington (1996: 40–1), lycan (1998: 110–11), Plantinga (1993, 198), Pollock (1986: 118–20, and Pollock and cruz (1999: 116–18). For a recent example, see lemos (2007: 92–4). A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M 193 vii cf. Goldman (1986: 49–51). viii The present proposal was briefly outlined in olsson (2012: 195–7). ix The generality problem may also be thought of as the normative problem of how to resolve conflict concerning the proper categorizations of belief‐forming processes. Suppose X types process token t in one way whereas y types that same token in another way, and that the effect is that X and y differ in their reliability assessment. The problem is whether there is a ratio- nal way for X and y to come to an agreement on how to type the process, e.g., by adopting a common type representing “suspension of judgment.” Intriguing as this problem is, it arises in principle for any epistemological theory, and not just for reliabilism. With regard to any theory of justification, for instance, we may ask how it proposes to resolve conflicting judg- ments regarding the applicability of the target property. x carnap should be credited for an unusually clear and plausible formulation of the sense in which a conceptual analysis should be faithful to ordinary usage. According to one of his requirements on a good philosophical “explication,” “[t]he explicatum [the thing which explicates] is to be similar to the explicandum [the thing to be explicated] in such a way that, in most cases in which the explicandum has so far been used, the explicatum can be used; how- ever, close similarity is not required, and considerable differences are permitted” (carnap 1950: 70). xi I am indebted to Martin l. Jönsson for the proposal to use film sequences for this purpose. xii We would like to use two groups in order to avoid various framing problems. If one group were to assess both justification and reliability, say in that order, the members’ assessment of justification might conceivably influence their assessment of reliability. xiii Similarly, a reliabilist theory of knowledge would be confirmed, with regard to faithfulness to ordinary language, if, in a significant number of cases, whenever all or almost all members of one group of subjects agrees that the person in the episode knows, all or almost all members of the reliability group agrees that the belief in question was reliably acquired. by contrast, if, in a significant number of cases, the members in the knowledge group agreed that the person knows, without the members of the second group reporting that the person’s belief was reli- ably acquired, that would disconfirm the reliabilist theory of knowledge. xiv See conee and Feldman (1998: 22–3), where they argue against Heller’s claim that the rele- vant process type will be contextually determined in many situations in which knowledge or justification is attributed: “There are some situations in which phrases referring to process tokens apparently work in the way Heller describes. For example, suppose Jones says, ‘I have three ways to start my old jalopy: first, shifting into gear while rolling it down a hill; second, jump‐starting it; and third, praying and then turning the key. only the first two usually work.’ Suppose that Jones then starts his car by jump‐starting it. He remarks: P. ‘The process by which I just started my car is reliable’. Here, Jones’s explicit mention of the three types serves to limit drastically the types under con- sideration. The token mentioned in (P) is of one of those types only … In typical knowledge at- tributions, however, no contextual narrowing of candidate process types occurs … ordinarily, no class of types of belief‐forming processes will have been made contextually salient. And nothing else about typical contexts isolates any one type.” See also Feldman and conee (2002: 102, foot- note 1). xv cf. Rogers and Patterson (2007: 451): “… basic level effects are among the best known and most robust phenomena in the study of human categorization.” xvi See Rosch et al. (1976: 383–5) for details. xvii The Rosch rule suffers from imprecision concerning how many attributes it takes to form a “cluster.” This potential shortcoming turns out to be inconsequential in the present context, as we will focus on a special case of the rule in which the notion of an attribute cluster plays no role. 194 A N A T u RA l ISTI c A PPR o A c H T o TH e Ge N e RA l IT y P R oble M xviii Variants of the explanatory model originally proposed by Rosch and colleagues have con- tinuously been employed in order to explain phenomena connected with categorization and non‐logical reasoning. See Jönsson and Hampton (2006, 2008) for recent examples. xix Rosch et  al. (1976): “the principle of category formation … is claimed to be universal” (435). See also Mervis and Rosch (1981: 93). Zacks and Tversky (2001) discuss some work confirming the existence of basic‐level effects in event categorization. xx “Seeing” is here and elsewhere taken in its non‐veridical sense. xxi Alternatively, “not very reliable (for scientific/legal purposes)” could be added as an attri- bute of the category Seeing less than clearly. xxii Rosch et al. (1976: 390–1) found empirical support for the claim that Tree is a basic level object category. xxiii cf. corter and Gluck (1992: 293): “our basic assumption is that there is functional value for a person to have accurate information about the features of things. For example, an organ- ism searching for food needs to know whether a given plant part is poisonous, nutritive, sweet, tough, and so on. Some features of instances may be useful only indirectly  –  for example, to generate tests to confirm tentative identifications. However, because a person will experience a variety of need states and goals across time, generally, there is value for the person to have accurate information about all the features of instances.” xxiv The result of single‐purpose classification might diverge from the result of multi‐purpose classification, which is in this case Seeing. Take as the single‐purpose attribute that of being very reliable. In the list of attributes for Figure 8.2, “very reliable” appears only at the level of Seeing clearly, which is therefore the single‐purpose basic‐level category. xxv This is the term used by corter and Gluck (1992: 296). xxvi As Goldman reminded me, brandom (1998) describes analogously unending switches in reliability as one proceeds from one process category to another. xxvii Non‐monotonic effects arise in scientific taxonomies as well. In biology, the category Whale is subordinate to the category Mammal and yet the mammal attribute “lives on land” is not inherited by the Whale category. Another classical example involves penguins – birds that, unlike most, do not fly. xxviii This proposal bears some similarity, at an abstract level, to the statistical rule advocated in beebe (2004). For a critical discussion of beebe’s specific proposal, see Dutant and olsson (2013). xxix The present chapter was submitted for publication in this volume in late 2011. The criti- cism of conee and Feldman’s central argument herein inspired Jönsson to conduct his careful and detailed empirical study. xxx A further worry raised by Goldman in our personal communications centered on the issue whether the agreement observed in people’s responses may be subject to instability, e.g., dependent on the order in which the examples were presented, analogously to how Swain, Alexander and Weinberg (2008) found the order of examples to be significant in how people judged Gettier cases. In order to eliminate any doubts of this nature, Jönsson was careful to construct his experiment so as to eliminate any dependence of the results on the order in which examples were presented.

Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. There have been many attempts to solve the generality problem for process reliabilism (a problem that arises equally for many other epistemologies). The approach of erik olsson, however, is arguably the most original and most insightful. As is clear, however, olsson’s discussion makes no attempt to provide a formula – an “explicit rule,” as he puts it – by means of which a token belief‐forming process can be assigned a uniquely “right type” (for the purpose of making a justificational assessment.) olsson’s declining to provide such an “explicit rule” may incline many readers to say that he leaves process reliabilism with a big problem, even if everything he says is true. What, then, has olsson contributed to the support of process reliabilism? Philosophers are accustomed to asking questions of the form “What is X?”, where they insist on getting answers in the form of necessary and sufficient conditions. but it is unreasonable to expect answers of this kind for all terms in the language, or for all meta- physical types. (In the epistemological context this has been emphasized by Timothy Williamson, 2000). More generally, however, there is a variety of philosophically interesting questions other than “What is X?”, and olsson’s approach may be an excellent example of a different kind of question and a different kind of answer. Robert Nozick’s (1981) book Philosophical Explanations is a large book devoted entirely to a (somewhat) different kind of philosophical question, which takes the form: “How is such‐and‐such possible?” Here is how he introduces this theme: Many philosophical problems are ones of understanding how something is or can be possible. How is it possible for us to have free will, supposing that all actions are causally determined? … How is it possible that we know anything, given the facts the skeptic enumerates …? How is it possible that motion occurs, given Zeno’s arguments? (1981: 8) reply to Olsson 198 Re P l y T o o l SS o N I suggest that we can appreciate olsson’s undertaking in terms of a similar “how‐possibly” question. And the answer he offers to this question – especially when supplemented by the work of Martin Jonsson – is extremely interesting and promising. In the case of olsson’s work, however, we might better formulate the question, not as how is it possible that X, but “How is it possible that people’s judgments (about justification) are so similar, or convergent, if process reliabilism is the correct theory of justification?” Phrased otherwise, how is it possible, if process reliabilism is true, that people make convergent judgments about cases, even when there are no salient linguistic clues in the context?” Recall, this was the kind of challenge that conee and Feldman are said to be pushing, according to olsson. I think this is a fair reading of them, and that’s how I will interpret the matter in what follows. We philosophers are regularly asking whether and how people’s judgments, or intuitions about cases are consistent or compatible with certain theories. The present formulation of the challenge olsson puts on the table is of that type. My formulation in terms of the “how‐possible” format is intended as a restatement of olsson’s question. A distinctive feature of olsson’s answer, however, is that the findings of empirical psychology are brought into play in providing his answer: how it is possible for there to be judgment convergence even (or perhaps especially) under reliabilism. We should remind ourselves that in the last few decades many epistemologists have made at least limited use of psychology in defending accounts of knowledge, justification, etc. So olsson’s method- ology is perfectly in step with the times. The chief difference in olsson’s case is a more extensive and detailed use of psychology. The specimens of psychology olsson invokes are not so widely known among philoso- phers, but they comprise a “classic” body of research that has withstood the test of time. In its origin it is the work of eleanor Rosch and colleagues (1976) beginning in the 1970s. This work on “basic‐level” categories has survived a great deal of experimentation. And the original work was extended to event‐like categories (Zacks and Tversky 2001), which resemble more closely the kinds of things discussed here, namely, belief‐forming processes. The so‐called “basic‐level effect” arises from two cognitive mechanisms that are universally operative in human categorization. cognizers prefer “useful” categories in the sense that interesting attributes can be inferred (probabilistically) from them. They also favor narrow categories, which are maximally informative or parsimonious. The upshot is that people (visually) presented with the same events or scenarios will tend to prefer much the same descriptors or categories, despite the absence of linguistic cues. Martin Jonsson (2013) has done a series of experiments concerning the hypotheses that olsson has advanced, and broadly speaking their results seem consistent with these (reliabilistic) hypotheses. The experiments themselves are too detailed to try to summarize in this brief space. However, if they indeed have adequate evidence for correlations between judg- ments of reliability and justifiedness, of the kind olsson illustrates early in his chapter, the whole package may comprise a very clever defense of process reliabilism, despite the absence of an explicit rule for selecting a unique process type for each process token. Suppose we concede that olsson (and Jonsson) have given us reason to believe that process reliabilism is compatible with convergence on reliability judgments. How does this show that justifiedness is systematically correlated with reliability? That is the central Re P l y T o o l SS o N 199 thesis (at least in the original, simple version) of process reliabilism. Here we already have all of the many cases that process reliabilists have adduced of the very high correlation between beliefs being caused by reliable processes and also being (intuitively) justified. The fact that reliabilism continues to be a very seriously discussed theory provides evidence that philosophers have found a very large number of such correlations quite persuasive. The debate, of course, centers on ostensible counterexamples. but the massive number of positive correlations (most of them unreported) is the most important part of the positive evidence in favor of reliabilism. It supports the thesis that process reliabilism is true, not merely possibly true. References Jonsson, M. (2013) A reliabilism built on cognitive convergence. Episteme 10 (3), pp.241–68. Nozick, R.

Veritism and Epistemic Value Dun can P rit char D 9 Introductory Remarks One of Alvin Goldman’s most distinctive contributions to epistemology – and there are many – concerns his development of a thorough‐going reliabilism in the theory of knowl- edge. A common complaint against reliabilist views of the sort that Goldman defends, however, is that they are unable to account for the greater value of knowledge relative to mere true belief. i This problem is known as the swamping problem, for reasons that will become apparent below. For some authors, being able to account for the greater value of knowledge is a key desideratum of any theory of knowledge.ii Goldman agrees. He writes: The extra‐value‐of‐knowledge […] problem can be used to test the adequacy of accounts of knowledge. Suppose an analysis of knowledge is incompatible with knowledge having an added value [relative to mere true belief]. That would be a pretty strong argument against the adequacy of that analysis. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 22) If there is a problem in this regard, it thus follows that it is important even by Goldman’s lights that he has an adequate response to it. He thinks he does, but I am not so sure, and I here explore my reasons for being sceptical about Goldman’s treatment of the swamping problem. I also argue, however, that when the swamping problem is properly understood, then there is a very straightforward response available to Goldman. In section 1, I set out the swamping problem and argue that it does not pose a challenge which is specific to reliabilism, but rather presents a challenge to a certain conception of epistemic value (known as veritism) which Goldman also endorses. In section 2, I critically ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 201 evaluate  –  and find wanting  –  the first of Goldman’s two responses to this problem, whereby he appeals to the greater future value of reliably formed true belief over mere true belief. In section 3, I critique Goldman’s second response to the swamping problem, which makes use of a process that he calls value autonomization. Finally, in section 4, I put forward what I think Goldman should say in response to the swamping problem. In particular, I argue that once the conclusion of the swamping argument is properly understood, he can reasonably treat it as harmless. 1 The Swamping Problem Here is the swamping problem in outline. reliability in our beliefs is something which is only of value because it is a means to true belief. But if that’s right, then having a belief which is both reliably formed and true can be no better than a belief that is merely true. After all, we only care about our beliefs being reliably formed because we know that reliability is a means to true belief, but once we have the true belief the reliability of the belief‐forming process can contribute no additional value. An analogy will be helpful here.iii Suppose one is a lover of coffee. As a lover of coffee, one will value reliable coffee‐making machines – that is, coffee‐making machines which regularly produce delicious coffee. Accordingly, one will seek out coffee that is produced by such a machine. Still, one only cares about the fact that a cup of coffee is produced by a reliable coffee‐making machine because one cares about drinking good coffee. Imagine that one is presented with two identical cups of coffee. Both are clearly deli- cious and equally optimal in every respect – that is, in terms of smell, texture, color, and so on. But only one of them was produced by a reliable coffee‐making machine, with the other one produced by an unreliable coffee‐making machine, one that just happened to produce delicious coffee on this occasion. Should one now prefer the cup of coffee produced by the reliable coffee‐making machine to the cup of coffee produced by the unreliable coffee‐making machine? On the face of it, there seems no reason why one should. (If you are unconvinced, ask yourself the question of whether you would be will- ing to pay more for the one cup of coffee over the other, given that they are, ex hypothesi, identical). Indeed, insofar as one is satisfied that the two cups of coffee are identical, and equally delicious, then it seems that one should be indifferent to whether they were produced by a reliable or unreliable coffee‐making machine. Here is a way of thinking about what is going on here. One cares about reliable coffee‐making machines because one cares about the output of those machines, but once one has the output it no longer matters how that output was produced, since that’s only significant as a means to that output. So while it is not in dispute that reliable coffee‐ making machines are valuable, they do not – cannot – contribute any additional value to the item that they are valuable as a means to – viz. delicious coffee. In short, since the value of being produced by a reliable coffee‐making machine is down to the value of good coffee, when one has good coffee in hand, then this value swamps any value that might be contributed by this good coffee being produced by a reliable coffee‐making machine. 202 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue The idea is that what goes for good coffee and reliable coffee‐making machines also goes for true belief and reliable belief‐forming processes. When faced with two identical true beliefs, one formed via a reliable belief‐forming process and one not, there is nothing from a purely reliabilist point of view to set them apart, since they are both equally valu- able. But if knowledge is understood as just reliable true belief (which is the view here being attributed to the reliabilist), then it follows that by reliabilist lights knowledge can be of no more value than mere true belief. let’s try to spell out this argument in a little more detail. First, we have a general claim about instrumental value, such that if a property (like being reliably formed, when it comes to beliefs, or being reliably produced, when it comes to coffee) is only instrumen- tally valuable relative to some further good (for example, true belief or great coffee), then in cases in which the further good in question is already present, no further value is con- ferred by the presence of the instrumentally valuable property. next we have a claim which is specific to reliabilism, to the effect that the value of the reliability of a belief‐ forming process is instrumental value relative to the good of true belief. putting these two claims together, we get the claim that reliably formed true belief is no more valuable than mere true belief. This intermediate conclusion, in conjunction with the further thesis that knowledge for the reliabilist is nothing more than reliable true belief, gives us our ultimate conclusion that knowledge can be no more valuable than mere true belief. Here, then, is the swamping problem for reliabilism: The swamping problem for reliabilism (p1) If the value of a property possessed by an item is only instrumental value relative to a further good and that good is already present in that item, then this property can confer no additional value to that item. (p2) The value of the property of being a reliably formed belief is instrumental value relative to the good of true belief. (c1) reliably formed true belief is no more valuable than mere true belief. [From (p1), (p2)] (p3) Knowledge is reliably formed true belief. (c2) Knowledge is no more valuable than mere true belief. [From (c1), (p3)] A few comments about this argument as it is presented here are in order. First, Goldman is unusual in that he holds that knowledge – at least, as he puts it, in a “weak” sense  –  can be nothing more than true belief. iv now if knowledge were always nothing more than true belief, then clearly Goldman would be unable to account for the greater value of knowledge over true belief even if we set aside the swamping problem. For if knowledge is just true belief, then it immediately follows that there can be nothing more valuable about the former relative to the latter, since the former just is the latter. Fortunately, Goldman doesn’t hold that knowledge is always just true belief, and so this particular variant of the value problem for knowledge doesn’t arise for his view. In what follows, we will focus on his position with regard to knowledge insofar as it demands more than merely true belief. ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 203 Second, Goldman doesn’t hold that knowledge is nothing more than reliably formed true belief. For example, he holds that there might well need to be an anti‐luck condition added to one’s theory of knowledge in order to deal with Gettier‐style cases.v Strictly speaking, then, (p3) is false by his lights, and hence the ultimate conclusion, (c2), doesn’t go through. even so, I think Goldman would be wise to grant this premise for the sake of argument (which he seems willing to do). There are three reasons for this. The first is that since reliability is the main epistemic condition on knowledge laid down by reliabilism, then the intermediate conclusion of this argument, (c1), seems in itself bad enough from the reliabilist point of view. Why, one might ask, is reliability such an important epistemic property if it doesn’t add any value to a true belief ? The second reason is that it doesn’t appear that what needs to be added to reliably formed true belief to get knowledge will itself confer any additional value on a mere true belief by reliabilist lights. For example, if the property of being reli- ably formed doesn’t confer value on a true belief, then why should the property of not being subject to Gettier‐style epistemic luck?vi Finally, the third and most important reason is that once we examine the more general form of the swamping argument, then it becomes apparent that even if Goldman were to reject (p3) he would still be faced with a version of the swamping argument in virtue of his commitment to a certain view about epistemic value. In order to see this last point, we first need to note that the underlying thinking behind the swamping problem does not seem to be specific to reliabilism. All that matters to the swamping problem is that the epistemic property in question should be merely instru- mentally valuable relative to the good of true belief, since once this much is granted, then one can generate a swamping problem. reliability fits this template, but so do, arguably, lots of other epistemic properties too. One could imagine an epistemologist arguing, for example, that the property of being justified is only instrumentally valuable relative to the good of true belief. If so, then one could run a parallel swamping argument targeted at justification which has as much force as the argument just presented.vii With this point in mind, then one could conceive of the swamping argument more generally as a reductio of a certain view of epistemic value, such that what really matters from an epistemic point of view is just true belief, with all other epistemic properties being merely instrumentally valuable relative to the good of true belief. Goldman himself explicitly adheres to such a conception of epistemic value – which he calls veritism – but there will be other epistemologists who fall into this camp, and who will likewise need to respond to this problem.viii Here then is the swamping problem in its general form, such that it is focused on a problem posed for epistemological theories which endorse veritism rather than specifi- cally targeted at reliabilism: The swamping problem for veritism (p1*) If the value of a property possessed by an item is only instrumental value relative to a further good and that good is already present in that item, then this property can confer no additional value to that item. 204 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue (p2*) epistemic properties are only instrumentally valuable relative to the good of true belief. [veritism] (c*) Knowledge is no more valuable than mere true belief. [From (p1*), (p2*)] (p1*) is meant to be a conceptual axiological truth. (p2*) just expresses veritism.ix And (c*) is held to follow logically from (p1*) and (p2*). With the swamping argument so formulated, such that the only epistemological prem- ise concerns veritism, it is clear that the real focus here is a specifically epistemic value. That is, when we talk about “epistemic value” we can have one of two things in mind. On the one hand, we might have in mind a particular type of value which is epistemic. On the other hand, we might just be talking about the value of something epistemic, where that value may or may not be specifically epistemic. It is important to keep these two notions apart, since otherwise this can lead to confusion, as what is of specifically epistemic value might not be of value more generally (and, of course, what is of value more generally might not be of specifically epistemic value). x Henceforth, when we talk of “epistemic value” we will have in mind a kind of value which is specifically epistemic. consider veritism in this regard. This is explicitly a claim about epistemic value. That is, in terms of the epistemic domain, true belief plays a foundational axiological role, in that according to veritism we are to regard all epistemic standings as being merely instru- mentally valuable relative to the non‐instrumentally valuable epistemic good of true belief. note, however, that it does not follow from the fact that an epistemic standing is of instrumental epistemic value that it is thereby of instrumental value more generally, and neither does it follow from the fact that true belief is of non‐instrumental – or, as it is sometimes called, final – epistemic value that it is thereby of non‐instrumental value more generally. Take the latter point first. There are three main options in this respect. The first is that true belief, while of non‐ instrumental epistemic value, is of no value at all generally speaking. The second is that true belief is not only of non‐instrumental epistemic value, but is also of instrumental value more generally speaking. And the third option is that true belief is not only of non‐ instrumental epistemic value, but is also of non‐instrumental value generally speaking. While one can see a case being made for options one and three, option two looks the most plausible. For true belief is surely something that has all kinds of practical benefits, espe- cially when it comes to fulfilling our goals, which is to say that it is of general instrumental value. But whichever option we choose in this regard, the point remains that one needs additional argumentation to make the further claim – none of these options is entailed by the fact that within the specific epistemic domain true belief has non‐instrumental value. What goes for the non‐instrumental epistemic value of true belief applies, mutatis mutandis, to the instrumental epistemic value of epistemic standings. Take the epistemic standing of having a belief that is reliably formed as an example. That one’s belief has this epistemic standing entails, according to veritism, that it is of instrumental epistemic value. But we cannot conclude from this that such a standing is in general of value, instru- mental or otherwise. perhaps, for example, having reliably formed true beliefs actually runs counter to your practical interests. If so, then on this score at least this epistemic standing will not be generally of instrumental value. And the idea that this epistemic ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 205 standing is in general of non‐instrumental value will be even harder to defend. For why should this be so? That is, why would we (rightly) value reliably formed belief as an end in itself, as opposed merely as a means to some further end? properly formulated, then, the swamping problem is thus a challenge to a particular conception of epistemic value that Goldman endorses. now that we have a clear handle on the challenge posed by the swamping problem, we are in a position to consider how Goldman responds to this problem.xi 2 Goldman on the Swamping Problem I: Conditional Probability In a recent paper jointly authored with erik Olsson (Goldman and Olsson 2009), Goldman offers two responses to the swamping problem. The first – which is described as the con- ditional probability solution – involves appeal to the future value of having a true belief which is reliably formed as opposed to one that is merely true. The second appeals to a process – which is described as value autonomization – whereby something can “inherit” value from something else. Interestingly, while both authors endorse both responses to the swamping problem, they nonetheless note that Olsson’s preference is for the first response and Goldman’s preference is for the second response. xii With this in mind, although I will comment on both of these proposals for dealing with the swamping problem, my focus will mostly be on the second proposal which Goldman favors.xiii According to the conditional probability response to the swamping problem, the addi- tional value that a reliable true belief has over a mere true belief is that the probability of having more true belief (of a similar kind) in the future is greater conditional on the subject having a reliable true belief that p than when conditional on the subject merely having a true belief that p. Goldman illustrates this point by appeal to what he takes to be the analogous case of gaining good coffee from a reliable coffee‐making machine: If a good cup of espresso is produced by a reliable espresso machine, and this machine remains at one’s disposal, then the probability that the next cup of espresso will be good is greater than the probability that that next cup of espresso will be good given that the first good cup was just luckily produced by an unreliable machine. […] This probability enhance- ment is a valuable property to have. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 28) And what goes for good coffee is held to also hold for true belief. Where true belief is reliably formed the conditional probability that one will form further true beliefs is higher than it would be if that true belief were the lucky consequence of an unreliable belief‐forming process. now one natural response to this sort of line of argument might be to contend that whether a particular reliable true belief has the extra value in play here is an entirely contingent matter. For example, if one knows that one will die in a few moments time, then it is hard to see why this line of argument would confer any additional value on a true belief that is reliably formed over a mere true belief, since one will be acutely aware of the fact that one won’t be having any future true beliefs. xiv 206 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue Goldman is sensitive to this issue, however, and he is careful to make clear that what is being claimed is not that this response to the swamping problem ensures that all reliably formed true belief is always of greater value than mere true belief, but only that it is gener- ally of greater value in the conditions that we find ourselves in. I think that this is entirely the right line to take. For one thing, the idea that knowledge is always and everywhere of more value than mere true belief is far from intuitive.xv But perhaps more importantly, the swamping problem does not need such a robust conception of the value of knowledge in order for the argument to run anyway. If the swamping argument is correct, then knowl- edge is never of greater value relative to mere true belief. Hence, if Goldman is able to defend the claim that knowledge is in general, in the conditions we find ourselves in, of greater value than mere true belief, then he has answered this problem. even so, I do not find the conditional probability response to the swamping problem at all plausible. In order to see why, consider again the remarks just quoted regarding the analogy with the coffee case. There seems to be a simple error in play here. It is undeni- ably true that being in possession of a reliable coffee‐making machine is valuable in virtue of the fact that it can produce additional good coffee in the future. But the key point is that this is a value that attaches to the machine and not to the cup of coffee that is produced by the machine. That is, it is not in dispute that reliable coffee‐making machines are more valuable than unreliable coffee‐making machines because only the former regularly produce good coffee. The issue, though, is whether a cup of coffee produced by a reliable coffee‐making machine is more valuable than one not produced in this way. And the whole point of the swamping problem (as applied to coffee) is that the undeniable value of reliable coffee‐making machines (including the fact that they can produce for you good coffee in the future) does not add value to any particular cup of coffee. What goes for good coffee goes for true belief. It is not in dispute that reliable belief‐ forming processes are more valuable than unreliable belief‐forming processes, and more valuable in virtue of the fact that they lead to further true beliefs. This much is just a consequence of veritism. What is in dispute is rather whether a particular true belief is of any greater value relative to a corresponding true belief in virtue of being reliably formed. The conditional probability response to the swamping problem does not seem to speak to this issue at all. xvi 3 Goldman on the Swamping Problem II: Value Autonomization This brings us to the second response to the swamping problem, which is the one that Goldman offers. This response appeals to a process that Goldman calls value autonomiza- tion, which is meant to be a particular way in which one kind of thing can derive value from its relationship to another kind of thing. Key to Goldman’s defense of this claim is to make a type‐token distinction. He writes: The swamping argument assumes that, according to reliabilism, the value of a token reliable process derives from the value of the token belief it produces. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 31) ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 207 Goldman wishes to resist this assumption: When tokens of type T 1 regularly cause tokens of type T2, which has independent value, then type T1 tends to inherit (ascribed) value from type T2. Furthermore, the inherited value accruing to type T 1 is also assigned or imputed to each token of T 1, whether or not such a token causes a token of T2. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 32) The example that Goldman gives to illustrate this claim is that of money: money (especially paper money) is not the sort of thing that has fundamental value. But since possessing money (in non‐trivial amounts) frequently produces events or states of affairs that do have fundamental value (pleasure, satisfaction, etc.,), possessing money comes to be viewed as an instrumentally valuable type of state. Furthermore, each token of this type inherits instrumental value from the type, even if some tokens don’t actually cause events or states of affairs with fundamental value. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 32) It’s not clear what Goldman means by “fundamental” value here, but it must at least be a kind of non‐instrumental value (even if it is restricted to a certain domain). So construed, the argument in play seems to be something like as follows. money isn’t in itself of any value, but as a general type its purchasing power creates a causal connection between pos- sessing money and gaining certain goods which are valuable. xvii As a type, then, money over time acquires instrumental value, where this value is also ultimately conferred on the tokens of this type also, even though it remains the case that not every token of this type stands in the relevant causal relationship to valuable goods (for example, where the money is unspent). Goldman is thus claiming that in certain conditions something which lacks value can acquire instrumental value in virtue of the causal relationship that the type stands in with regard to certain goods, even though not all tokens of that type stand in that causal relationship. The immediate concern with this claim is that it is hard to see how it relates to the swamping problem. After all, the value that is being attributed to the relevant tokens – presumably, though it’s not altogether clear from the passage itself, Goldman has in mind token events of possessing money – is just instrumental value. But if that’s right, then if we apply this line of reasoning to reliabilism, then it won’t offer us a way out of that problem. For consider an exactly analogous line of reasoning with regard to reliabilism. Having a belief which is formed by a reliable belief‐forming process is not the sort of thing that is in itself of value. But having reliable beliefs frequently produces events or states of affairs that do have non‐instrumental (epistemic) value – viz. true beliefs – and so having beliefs which are formed by reliable belief‐forming process comes to be viewed as instrumentally (epistemically) valuable. Furthermore, each token in this regard – presumably, the state of having a particular reliably formed belief – inherits this instrumental (epistemic) value, even though not every token is correlated with true belief. As should be clear, this line of reasoning at most establishes the instrumental epis- temic value of not just the relevant type (i.e., having beliefs which are formed by reliable 208 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue belief‐forming processes) but also the relevant tokens (i.e., having a particular belief which is formed by a particular reliable belief‐forming process). But how does that claim gain us any purchase on the swamping problem as set out above? In particular, this claim seems to be entirely compatible with the premises of the swamping problem. The general axiological premise is clearly still in place. But also too is veritism, since it still remains true that all epistemic standings, whether construed qua type or qua token, are only of instrumental epistemic value relative to the non‐instrumental epistemic good of true belief. It becomes clear from Goldman’s subsequent discussion, however, that he has some- thing very specific in mind when it comes to value autonomization. In the “money” exam- ple just given, the additional value that is being generated is of a specifically instrumental form, and that is why it is not helping him to resolve the swamping problem. But Goldman’s hope, it turns out, is that in the epistemic case this process of value autonomi- zation might actually generate non‐instrumental (or, as he calls it, “fundamental”) value. It is worth quoting Goldman’s remarks here at some length: consider the relationship between (morally) good actions and good motives. The primary locus of moral value […] is actions […]. Actions, however, are not the only things regarded as morally good or valuable. We also value good motives […]. Why do we value such motives? A straightforward explanation is that such motives regularly bring about corresponding actions, actions which themselves are valuable. It is therefore plausible that there is a pattern of inheritance by which value passes from types of actions to corresponding motive types, which regularly produce those actions. notice that a token motive of an appropriate type is regarded as good or valuable even if it fails to produce a good action. […] despite failing to produce good consequences of a standard sort, the token motive is still good or valuable, presumably because such value is inherited from the type of which it is a token. And this value it retains autonomously, even without triggering an independently good action. Good motives […] are naturally thought of as good in themselves. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 33) For the sake of argument we will grant the moral claims in play here, and in particular the general philosophical picture being put forward of the relationship between morally good actions and good motives. xviii What is salient for our purposes is that Goldman is using this case to argue that the process of value autonomization can generate non‐instrumental value. That is, the idea is that the relationship between morally good actions (which have non‐instrumental value) and good motives is such that via a pattern of inheritance this value over time transfers to tokens of the latter, even in cases where the motives do not lead to good actions. To begin with, let us suppose that Goldman could use a parallel argument to show that having a belief which is formed by a reliable belief‐forming process is non‐instrumentally epistemically valuable. That is, the primary locus of epistemic value is true belief, but we also epistemically value beliefs formed by reliable belief‐forming processes because of the relationship they stand in to true belief. Thus, over time, beliefs which are formed by reli- able belief‐forming processes come to be regarded as non‐instrumentally epistemically valuable too, even particular token beliefs of this type which are not in fact true. ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 209 This claim certainly would deal with the swamping argument, since it would now no longer be true that the epistemic value of an epistemic standing like being the result of a reliable belief‐forming process is necessarily instrumental epistemic value relative to the epistemic good of true belief. But if that’s right, then there is an epistemic value that attaches to this epistemic standing which is not swamped by the epistemic value that attaches to true belief. now one might think that to make this move is to give up on veritism, and thus that Goldman is here arguing himself into a contradiction, given his endorsement of this account of epistemic value. I think that would be too quick, however. What is certainly true is that the formulation of veritism offered above as (p2*) is inconsistent with this dialectical move, but I think a more sympathetic reading of what Goldman is up to here is that he is trying to highlight an ambiguity in our thinking about veritism. For Goldman, veritism is the view that ultimately all that matters from the epistemic perspective is true belief (see, for example, Goldman and Olsson 2009: 24). Although that claim does seem to be naturally formulated as something like (p2*), the point about value autonomization appears to show that this is not the best rendering of this thesis. For notice that the account being offered of the non‐instrumental epistemic value of having beliefs that are formed by reliable belief‐forming processes still grants that this epistemic value is in an important sense derivative on the epistemic value of true beliefs. recall that in the moral sphere the claim is that the non‐instrumental value of good motives is inherited from the non‐instrumental value of good actions, such that the latter has an axiological primacy over the former. The value autonomization that occurs in this realm, and which leads to good motives being of non‐instrumental moral value, is thus compatible with a moral analogue of veritism which says that ultimately all that matters from a moral point of view is morally good action. equally, in the epistemic sphere Goldman can claim that because the non‐instrumental epistemic value of having a belief formed by a reliable belief‐forming process is inherited from the non‐instrumental epis- temic value of true belief, so this need not be in conflict with the claim that all that matters from an epistemic point of view is true belief. When properly formulated, then, veritism is compatible with the non‐instrumental value of having a belief which is formed via a reliable belief‐forming process. So if Goldman can use this line of argument to show that having a belief which is formed by a reliable belief‐forming process is of non‐instrumental epistemic value, then he does seem to have a way of dealing with the swamping problem while retaining his veritism. everything thus hangs on whether he can argue for the non‐instrumental value of this epistemic standing in this way. unfortunately, the process of value autonomization, even if plausible in the moral case, doesn’t seem to be at all plausible in the epistemic case. In fact, when applied to the epis- temic case this process seems to represent a kind of fetishism about reliable belief‐forming processes. Given veritism, reliable belief‐forming processes are initially only instrumen- tally epistemically valuable since they enable one to gain the non‐instrumental epistemic good of true belief. Over time, though, the correlation between these belief‐forming processes and true belief is meant to ensure that we start to treat reliability in our belief‐ forming processes as itself of non‐instrumental epistemic value. As a claim about human 210 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue psychology this may well be right, but the key point would remain that to treat reliable belief‐forming processes as being of non‐instrumental epistemic value in this way would be to confer a value on them which by veritistic lights is simply not warranted. The case of money is a good analogy in this regard. It is undoubtedly true, for example, that the correlations between having money and gaining goods which the subject believes are non‐instrumentally valuable can over time lead a subject to regard money as being itself non‐instrumentally valuable. But to ascribe such a value to money is mistaken, as it is simply not the kind of thing that has non‐instrumental value (think, for example, of the miser in this regard). The same goes by veritistic lights for reliable true belief. Another way of putting this point is that while it is undoubtedly true that agents can over time come to treat things which are of instrumental value (such as money or reliable true belief) as being of non‐instrumental value, it doesn’t follow from the fact that something is valued non‐ instrumentally that it is of non‐instrumental value (as the case of the miser illustrates). xix I would imagine that Goldman would respond to this objection by insisting that when it comes to its axiology the epistemic domain is more akin to the moral domain than the financial domain. Thus, he will contend that it is more appropriate to compare the rela- tionship between reliably formed true belief and mere true belief to morally good motives and morally good actions rather than to money and the goods and services which money can acquire. The problem, though, is that moral value seems to be very different from epistemic value. I noted earlier that we cannot obviously conclude from the fact that something (for example, a belief) has epistemic value that it is therefore of value in general. True belief may be of non‐instrumental epistemic value, but it would be a big jump to infer that true belief is therefore non‐instrumentally valuable simpliciter. moral value is very different in this respect, however, in that typically to say that something is morally valuable is to say that it is valuable simpliciter. Think, for example, about the claim that morally good actions are non‐instrumentally valuable. clearly, this claim at least entails that they are non‐instrumentally valuable from a moral point of view. But intuitively, it entails a stronger claim also  –  viz. that these actions are non‐instrumentally valuable from any point of view. This is not to deny that there may be other axes of evaluation relative to which there might be some sort of trade‐ off when it comes to assessing the overall goodness of an action. perhaps, say, practical or aesthetic or epistemic (etc.) considerations also have a role to play here. But at most these considerations surely only blunt the extent of the non‐instrumental value in play, and cannot completely undermine it. For imagine what it would mean for, say, a practical consideration to completely undermine the non‐instrumental moral value of an action. can the practical disbenefits of doing something morally right ever ensure that, all things considered, doing the morally right action lacks any non‐instrumental goodness? From an axiological point of view, then, the moral domain is very different from other domains, and certainly a domain like the epistemic, where there seems no direct route from something being of epistemic non‐instrumental value to it being of non‐instrumental value simpliciter. But with this disanalogy in play, it is far from clear that there can plausibly be a process of value autonomization in the epistemic case which generates non‐instrumental value. ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 211 That is, I think that the story Goldman offers of how value autonomization works in the moral case is only plausible because of the special nature of moral goodness. If the morally good is non‐instrumentally good simpliciter, then it is reasonable to contend that that which is a reliable means to the morally good is non‐instrumentally good simpliciter too. For example, if morally good actions are a central part of a good life – that is, a life of flourishing – and morally good motives are the best route to morally good actions, then it is plausible to suppose that morally good motives are a central part of a good life too. Thus even if the moral value of the latter is ultimately derivative on the moral value of the former, nonetheless they are both of general non‐instrumental value. In order to run the same argument for epistemic value, however, we would need some basis for holding that what is non‐instrumentally epistemically good (that is, true belief according to veritism) is non‐instrumentally good simpliciter. not only has Goldman not offered us a basis for this claim, but such a thesis seems in any case to be suspect. True belief may be non‐instrumentally valuable from an epistemic perspective, but it is hard to see why it would be thought to be non‐instrumentally valuable simpliciter. note that I am not claiming here that there aren’t epistemic goods which are non‐ instrumentally valuable simpliciter. Indeed, I think there are such goods, and that their goodness precisely consists in the role they play in a life of flourishing.xx crucially, though, the kind of epistemic goods that might plausibly play such a role – such as wisdom, under- standing, and other kinds of sophisticated cognitive achievements – are very different from the kind of epistemic good that is the focus of veritism, viz. simple, unadorned, true belief. my ultimate worry about Goldman’s appeal to value autonomization is thus that it only looks plausible because the example given concerns a domain which, unlike the epistemic domain, clearly appeals to a general non‐instrumental value. 4 How a Veristist should Respond to the Swamping Problem So what are Goldman’s options? There are some heroic routes that he might take, and an obvious one would be to maintain that the epistemic domain is on a par with the moral domain, such that non‐instrumental epistemic value has the same kind of axiological status as non‐instrumental moral value. perhaps Goldman will be tempted by such a line. I think, however, that he would be better advised to abandon the two responses to the swamping problem that he has defended, and take a more direct approach to this problem. In common with many commentators on this topic, Goldman tends to move seamlessly between general claims about value and claims which, on the surface of things anyway, seem to be about particular species of value, such as epistemic or moral value. In this paper, though, we have been keen to keep all the relevant distinctions in place. But with those distinctions in place, let’s look again at the swamping problem that we formulated above: The swamping problem for veritism (p1*) If the value of a property possessed by an item is only instrumental value relative to a further good and that good is already present in that item, then this property can confer no additional value to that item. 212 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue (p2*) epistemic properties are only instrumentally valuable relative to the good of true belief. [veritism] (c*) Knowledge is no more valuable than mere true belief. [From (p1*), (p2*)] This problem looks worrying for someone like Goldman, precisely because he denies (c*) and holds that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. But with the foregoing in mind it ought to be clear that the swamping argument doesn’t really sup- port (c*) after all. For notice that the kind of value in play in (p2*) is specifically epistemic value, and hence it follows that the kind of value at issue in the conclusion should be epistemic value too. That is, what (p1*) and (p2*) support is not (c*), but rather the weaker (c**): (c**) Knowledge is no more epistemically valuable than mere true belief. [From (p1*), (p2*)] Here is the crux. The conclusion of this reformulated version of the swamping argu- ment is entirely compatible with the thought that knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief, which is what Goldman wants to defend. For the claim being made in (c**) is only that knowledge is not epistemically more valuable than mere true belief, and that is a much more specific claim. With that in mind, it is entirely open for someone like Goldman to maintain, in line with his veritism, that all that really counts from an epistemic point of view is true belief, while maintaining that there is nonetheless more to the value of knowl- edge than the epistemic value of true belief. Indeed, I think Goldman is on strong ground in this regard, in that it seems that there are at least lots of practical benefits to having knowledge as opposed to having merely true belief, and that means that there is a greater instrumental non‐epistemic value to knowing as opposed to merely truly believing. Indeed, there may even be wider benefits which are specific to knowledge that extend beyond the practical. perhaps, for example, having knowledge plays some fundamental role in a life of flourishing, such that it inherits a general non‐instrumental value from playing this role? xxi In any case, it seems to me that the reason why Goldman gets vexed about this problem is because he grants – to be fair, in common with most parties to this debate – that the swamping problem is about the general question of the greater value of knowledge relative to true belief. But once it becomes clear that this problem is specifically concerned with the greater epistemic value of knowledge relative to true belief, then there is nothing here that the veritist should worry about. veritism, after all, is a claim about epistemic value, and so construed it is simply a consequence of the view that knowledge is no more valuable, from a specifically epistemic point of view, than mere true belief. But, crucially, it does not follow from this that knowledge is not more valuable than mere true belief. At the outset of our discussion we cited Goldman’s own remarks on the value problem: The extra‐value‐of‐knowledge […] problem can be used to test the adequacy of accounts of knowledge. Suppose an analysis of knowledge is incompatible with knowledge having an added value [relative to mere true belief]. That would be a pretty strong argument against the adequacy of that analysis. (Goldman and Olsson 2009: 22) ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue 213 That is, the challenge Goldman sees as being laid down by the value problem for knowledge is that one’s epistemology had better not be incompatible with the claim that knowledge has more value than true belief. Given the foregoing, however, it should be clear that Goldman’s epistemology – that is, his reliabilism and, more generally, his veritism – passes the test that is being laid down here. For while veritism entails that reliable true belief (and thus knowledge) is of no more epistemic value than mere true belief, veritism is entirely compatible with the claim that knowledge is generally more valuable than mere true belief. Appeals to conditional probability or a complex process of value autonomization are thus by‐the‐by. properly formulated, the swamping problem poses no challenge for Goldman’s view at all.xxii Notes i See, for example, Jones (1997), Swinburne (1999), riggs (2002a, 2002b), Kvanvig (2003) and Zagzebski (2003). ii See, especially, Kvanvig (2003). iii This example is due to Zagzebski (2003). iv See Goldman (1999) for more on this distinction between weak and strong senses of “know.” v See, for example, Goldman and Olsson (2009: 22–3). vi Goldman makes this point himself. See Goldman and Olsson (2009: 22–3). vii I’m not the first to make this point. For example, percival (2003: 32–3) makes essentially the same claim. viii Goldman defends veritism in a number of places, but see especially Goldman (1999, 2002). elsewhere  –  see, e.g., pritchard et  al. (2010: ch. 1) and pritchard (2011)  –  I’ve referred to veritism as epistemic value T‐monism, to make clear that this is a conception of epistemic value where there is only one fundamental epistemic good, and where the fundamental epistemic good in question is true belief rather than some other epistemic standing. For more on verit- ism, see david (2001), and the exchange between david (2005) and Kvanvig (2005). ix note that my formulation of veritism implicitly takes it as given that being true is not an epistemic property of a belief. nothing hangs on this (if one prefers, one could simply add a caveat to make clear that it is epistemic properties of belief other than being true that are at issue here). note also that veritism as it stands is logically stronger than it needs to be for the purposes of this argument. What is important for this argument, after all, is just that the epi- stemic properties which are relevant to knowledge (and which are thus epistemic properties of beliefs) are only instrumentally valuable relative to the epistemic good of true belief. We will set this complication to one side in what follows. x This is an instance of the more general point that Geach (1956) makes about predicative and attributive adjectives. In particular, from “x is a big flea” it does not follow that “x is a flea” and “x is big,” since the claim being made is only the attributive claim that x is big for a flea. (compare: “x is a red flea”). xi For further discussion of the nature of the swamping problem – and in particular how this problem relates to the more general problem regarding the value (epistemic or otherwise) of knowledge – see pritchard et al. (2010, ch. 1) and pritchard (2011). See also pritchard and Turri (2014; cf. pritchard 2007). xii See Goldman and Olsson (2009: 27). xiii For ease of expression, in what follows I will also just refer to Goldman, and not also to Olsson. 214 ver ITIS m A nd ep IST em I c v A l ue xiv This is essentially the critical line to this response to the swamping problem that is offered by meylan (“The value of knowledge: Against a reliabilist solution,” unpublished 2007). xv That said, and as Goldman and Olsson (2009: 30) note, some commentators, such as riggs (2002b: 79) and Kvanvig (2003: 57), are inclined to defend the stronger claim. xvi Olsson (2007, 2009) offers a more developed version of the conditional probability response to the swamping problem. Although I do not think the more developed version of this response is plausible, it would take me too far afield to explore it here. xvii I here (and in what follows) set aside the complicating case where money happens to be valuable in other ways, such as by being beautiful, or by having further uses beyond serving as a means of exchange. xviii For what it’s worth, I find the idea that morally good actions and morally good motives can be disengaged from each other in the manner implied here extremely suspect. xix Interestingly, Goldman does offer a brief discussion of this distinction between genuine and merely attributed value (see Goldman and Olsson 2009: 34–5), but he misidentifies the prob- lem that this distinction raises for value autonomization. This is because he thinks that an objector might appeal to this distinction in order to undermine the very idea of value autono- mization, when in practice the most obvious use of this distinction from a critical point of view will be with regard to the specific application of value autonomization to the epistemic case. xx I discuss epistemic goodness in a number of places. See, especially, pritchard (2009a, 2009b, 2011; forthcoming) and pritchard et al. (2010: chs 1–4). xxi elsewhere – see, e.g., pritchard (2009a, 2009b) and pritchard et al. (2010: ch. 2) – I have argued against the idea that knowledge has general non‐instrumental value, but it would take me too far afield to explore this issue here. xxii This paper was written while I was in receipt of a phillip leverhulme prize, and I am grate- ful to them for their support. elements of this paper were presented at a conference at the university of copenhagen in 2011, and I am grateful to the audience for their comments, particularly Alvin Goldman and erik Olsson.

I am appreciative of duncan pritchard’s offered assistance in how to respond to the swamping problem. But at the risk of looking a gift horse in the mouth, I am not going to adopt his solution. However, I will also not resurrect either of the two solutions advanced in the Goldman and Olsson (2009) paper. I am going to take a different tack, and argue that there is no prima facie value problem in the first place confronting reliabilism. The so‐called swamping “problem” is unworthy of the extensive attention it has received. Here is how pritchard formulates the so‐called swamping problem. reliability [in our belief‐forming processes] is something which is only of value because it is a means to true belief. But if that’s right, then having a belief which is both reliably formed and true can be no better than a belief that is merely true. After all, we only care about our beliefs being reliably formed because we know that reliability is a means to true belief, but once we have the true belief the reliability of the belief‐forming process can contribute no additional value. The following example illustrates how wrong‐headed is the swamping theorist’s diagno- sis. The example focuses on justification rather than knowledge, but justifiedness, after all, is a prominent member of the family of epistemic values. It behooves us to consult that important parallel with the knowledge case. Bert looks at a figure at dusk some 50 yards away, and forms the belief that it’s Sheila. He’s right; it is Sheila. In a variant case, Bert looks at a figure in excellent light only 10 yards away, and forms the belief that it’s Sheila. Here too he is right. could it be that Bert’s belief in the first case is marginally justified and therefore has a modest level of epistemic value whereas his belief in the second case is very highly justified and therefore has reply to Pritchard repl y T O  pr IT c HA rd 217 a much higher level of epistemic value? (Assume there are no other significant differences between the cases.) The swamping theorist will want to claim the following: “The reliabilist is unable to say that the belief ’s level of epistemic value  –  specifically, justificational value – in the second case is higher than its justificational value in the first case. This is because the respective belief‐forming processes cannot add any justificational value to the belief. each of them acquires its own justificational value from that belief; hence, its acquired value cannot be added, in either case, to the belief. Therefore, the belief ’s justi- ficational value must be the same in both cases. However, this is obviously wrong, says the swamping theorist. So much the worse for reliabilism.” Of course, this is ridiculous. The reliabilist can rightly insist that according to his/her theory, the output belief acquires its justifiedness from the reliability of its belief‐forming process. And the greater the latter’s reliability, the greater is the belief ’s justifiedness. Hence, the belief ’s justifiedness in the second case is greater than in the first case. Any other result would be contrary to the intent (and letter) of reliabilism. So the swamping theorist is just confused. Sometimes, for some kinds of value, the source or provenance of a target event or state of affairs counts for a lot. This is perfectly consistent with the swamping theorist’s being right with respect to gustatory value (as in the espresso case), that is, that provenance matters little if at all. The quality or value of a cup of espresso does not vary with the reliability of the machine that made it. But this feature need not apply, and does not apply, to all types of value. consider historical value, for example. many (token) devices, machines, pieces of equipment, etc. from an earlier era no longer have utilitarian value. nonetheless they may have historical value. What we mean by historical value is value arising from the object’s origin or prior history. Antiques, of course, are a special class of objects with that kind of value. reliabilists like me claim that certain important epistemic values (for example, knowledge and justifiedness) turn out to have the historical kind of value. Indeed I have sometimes used the very phrase “historical reliabilism” to characterize my brand of reliabilism (Goldman 1979). The swamping theorists aren’t wrong about espresso; but that single case provides no decisive parallel for epistemic value. How did the swamping theorist go so far astray? One contributing factor may have been a failure to appreciate the difference between what we might label “simple” instru- mental value transmission and “complex” instrumental value transmission. (Something like this idea appears in Goldman and Olsson, 2009). revisiting the swamping theorist’s argument, it looks as if s/he thinks that a token belief‐forming process acquires (derivative) value only from the particular state (of true belief) that the token process outputs. Then they argue that if that’s the only source of the token process’s value, such value has already been taken account of in the fundamental value of the output (true) belief. But this is based on a misunderstanding. The token process inherits epistemic value not only “directly” from the output belief it produces, but also (and primarily) from the type of which it is an instance. When the type is reliable, then it will have many instances of producing positive epistemic value and avoiding negative epistemic value. Those are all sources of derivative value for the process type. So the belief‐forming process token has additional sources of instrumental value that can be added – without duplication – to the fundamental value (if any) of the current true belief itself. 218 repl y T O  pr IT c HA rd References Goldman, A.

The Condorcet Jury Theorem and Voter‐Specific Truth Chri ST ian Li ST and K ai Sp ie K erm ann i 10 1 Introduction In his discussion of epistemic democracy in Knowledge in a Social World (1999), Alvin Goldman defends an interesting thesis about a special kind of knowledge relevant to democracy. He suggests that each voter in a democratic decision is confronted with what he calls the “core voter question.” Core voter question: “Which [candidate] would, if elected, produce a better outcome set from my point of view?” (Goldman 1999: 323) Obviously, a voter’s level of information and knowledge affects how reliably he or she is able to answer this question and, accordingly, whether the resulting vote will accurately reflect his or her interests or perspective. To capture this point, Goldman introduces three notions. A voter is said to have: • core voter knowledge if he or she believes the true answer to the core voter question;ii • core voter error if he or she believes the false answer; and • core voter ignorance if he or she has no opinion (Goldman 1999: 324). Goldman asserts the following: The central thesis: “[D]emocracy is successful, in a certain sense, when the electorate has full core knowledge” (Goldman 1999: 326). 220 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem “Success” here means that the candidate whose policies are best from the perspective of the largest number of voters wins. “Full core knowledge” of the electorate means that all voters have core voter knowledge. It is easy to see why this claim is true. If everyone believes the correct answer to his or her core voter question and votes in accordance with it, then the answer that is correct for the largest number of voters receives the most votes. Goldman’s thesis is in line with a conception of democracy that involves “truth‐tracking” and therefore fits the label “veritistic,” though with a twist. For Goldman, unlike some clas- sical epistemic democrats, it is not the case that there exists a voter‐independent truth as to which candidate is best simpliciter. rather, for each voter, there exists a voter‐specific truth as to which candidate is best for that voter. The combination (profile) of voter‐specific truths depends on the electorate in question and on the voters’ interests and perspectives. Given a particular set of voters, however, the profile of voter‐specific truths induces an overall, derivative truth as to which candidate is best from the perspective of the largest number of voters. Goldman’s thesis asserts that if the electorate has full core knowledge, this “overall” truth prevails under majority rule: the candidate who is best from the perspective of the largest number of voters will attract the most votes. The aim of this short chapter is to show that Goldman’s thesis can be recast as a gen- eralization of the classical condorcet jury theorem (see, for example, Grofman et  al. 1983; Boland 1989; List and Goodin 2001). roughly speaking, the jury theorem in its original form states that if voters are individually better than random at making a correct judgment on a factual question and mutually independent in their judgments, then the probability of a correct majority judgment increases and approaches one as the number of voters increases. The central move needed to recover Goldman’s thesis from a generalized jury theorem is to replace condorcet’s assumption that there is a single truth to be tracked with the assumption of multiple such truths: one for each voter. The correct decision in aggregate then depends on the profile of voter‐specific truths. We suggest that, once this move is properly implemented, Goldman’s thesis becomes a consequence of a generalized condorcet jury theorem. This matches a generalization of the jury theorem developed by miller (1986). The scope of this chapter is limited. Its contribution lies not in presenting a fully devel- oped technical result, but in exploring the conceptual relationship between Goldman’s thesis and the condorcet jury theorem. We refer readers to miller (1986) for a more techni- cal treatment. Further, in light of the limited scope of the present chapter, we are not able to do justice to the richness of Goldman’s work on democracy and social epistemology more broadly. Goldman’s ideas on core voter knowledge are just one aspect of this. 2 The Classical Condorcet Jury Theorem We begin by recapitulating condorcet’s jury theorem in its simplest form. Let there be n voters, labeled 1, 2, …, n, who are faced with a decision on a single binary question. There exists an objectively correct, albeit unknown, answer to it, which we would like the decision to track. examples of such a question are whether a defendant in a criminal trial TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 221 is guilty or innocent, whether a particular chemical is carcinogenic or not, whether policy A or B will lead to more economic growth (other things being equal), or any other factual yes/no question. Which questions in political contexts have objectively correct answers and in that sense qualify as “factual” is a separate matter that we cannot address here. Let us introduce the variable X to refer to the correct answer, which we call the truth. For simplicity, X can take the values 1 (for example, “guilty,” “carcinogenic,” “policy A”) or 0 (for example, “innocent,” “safe,” “policy B”).iii For each voter i, we write V i to denote voter i’s vote, where V i can take the values 1 or 0. Here V i = 1 represents a vote for answer “1,” while V i = 0 represents a vote for answer “0.” The classical jury theorem rests on two assumptions. To state the first, let us write Pr(A|B) for the conditional probability of event A, given event B. Voter competence: For each voter i and each possible truth x in {0,1}, p = Pr(Vi = x | X = x) exceeds ½ and is the same for all voters. Informally, this assumption says that each voter is better than random at identifying the truth, and that different voters are equally reliable. Furthermore, this holds irrespective of whether the truth is X = 1 or X = 0. Voter independence: The votes of all voters, V 1, V 2, …, V n, are mutually independent, conditional on the truth (which can be either X = 1 or X = 0). Informally, this says that once we hold the truth in question fixed – thereby conditional- izing either on X = 1 or on X = 0 – learning the votes of some voters does not give us any information about the votes of others. To state condorcet’s jury theorem, let us write V to denote the outcome of a majority vote. Formally, this is defined as follows: • V = 1 if there are more voters with V i = 1 than with V i = 0; • V = 0 if there are more voters with V i = 0 than with V i = 1; • V = 1/2 if there is a tie. The following result holds: Condorcet’s jury theorem: For each possible truth x in {0,1}, Pr(V = x | X = x) usually increases and converges to 1 as the total number n of voters increases. iv Informally, the probability of a correct majority decision grows with the size of electorate and approaches one in the limit, both when X = 1 and when X = 0. The “growth” result is called the non‐asymptotic part of the theorem, and the “convergence” result the asymptotic part. There is, of course, a vast literature on the interpretation of this theorem and its limita- tions. It goes without saying that both voter competence and voter independence are very demanding assumptions, which are often violated, and there are by now many proposals on how they can be weakened. v Since our aim is to explore the relationship between Goldman’s 222 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem thesis and the classical jury theorem, we here set these complications aside and keep in place as many elements of the classical framework as possible. Specifically, we identify the mini- mal modification needed in order to recover Goldman’s thesis in a condorcetian framework. 3 A Generalized Condorcet Jury Theorem with  Different Voter‐Specific Truths As before, we assume that n voters are faced with a binary decision. We label the two options 1 and 0. (Goldman’s analysis is also presented in this binary format. For a gener- alization of the classical jury theorem to non‐binary decisions, see List and Goodin 2001; in principle, a similar move is possible in relation to Goldman’s analysis too.) unlike in condorcet’s original framework, we no longer assume that there exists a single truth as to which of the two options is “correct.” Instead, we assume that different options can be “correct” for different voters, which corresponds to Goldman’s observation that the right answer to the “core voter question” may differ across voters. (This way of generalizing condorcet’s original framework follows the generalization offered in miller 1986.) For each voter i, we introduce the variable Xi to refer to the correct answer for voter i, which we call i’s voter‐specific truth. Since we have restricted our discussion to a binary format, X i can take two values, 1 or 0, depending on which of the options is the correct one for voter i. “core voter knowledge,” in Goldman’s terms, refers to a situation in which a given voter knows (or believes) his or her voter‐specific truth. “Full core knowl- edge” of the electorate is a situation in which all voters do so. As before, V 1, V2, …, V n represent the votes of the n voters. It is easy to see that, if V i = Xi for every voter i (the situation of “full core knowledge” of the electorate), then V (defined as the majority winner, as before) will indeed be the option that is “correct” for the majority of voters. Formally, full core knowledge of the electorate implies that: • V = 1 if there are more voters with X i = 1 than with X i = 0; • V = 0 if there are more voters with X i = 0 than with X i = 1; • V = 1/2 if there as many voters with X i = 0 as with X i = 1. This, in formalized terms, is Goldman’s original thesis about the implications of core voter knowledge. In what follows, we sketch a condorcetian generalization of this thesis. moving away from full core voter knowledge of every voter, we introduce the follow- ing, less demanding competence assumption: Core voter competence: For each voter i and each possible profile of voter‐specific truths ⟨x 1, x 2, …, x n⟩ in {0,1}n, p = Pr(V i = xi | X1 = x 1 & X2 = x 2 & … & X n = xn) exceeds ½ and is the same for all voters.vi Informally, this assumption says that each voter is better than random at identifying his or her voter‐specific truth, and that different voters are equally reliable. Furthermore, this  holds for every possible profile of voter‐specific truths. We also assume that the TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 223 competence parameter p does not depend on the total number of voters n. We next state a suitably modified independence assumption: Core voter independence: The votes of all voters, V1, V2, …, V n, are mutually independ- ent, conditional on the profile of voter‐specific truths (i.e., conditional on X 1 = x1 & X2 = x 2 & … & Xn = xn, where ⟨x 1, x 2, …, x n⟩ is in {0,1} n). Informally, this says that once we hold the voter‐specific truths in question fixed – thereby conditionalizing on the conjunction of all X is – learning the votes of some voters does not give us any information about the votes of others. note that condorcet’s original compe- tence and independence assumptions are special cases of core voter competence and core voter independence when X i is the same for all i. As suggested by Goldman, let the success criterion for a collective decision be that the option that is best from the perspective of the largest number of voters wins. Goldman thereby makes the normative assumption that there is a majoritarian relationship between any given profile of voter‐specific truths and the induced, derivative “truth” as to which option is correct overall. (This assumption could be further justified, for instance, by invoking (i) an axiomatic characterization of majoritarianism such as may’s 1952 theorem or (ii) the observation that the majoritarian relationship minimizes the number of discrep- ancies between the “overall truth” and the individual voter‐specific truths. We here set these issues aside. For further discussion of (i) and (ii), see List 2013: sects 2.2, 2.4.) Formally, for each possible profile of voter‐specific truths ⟨x1, x2, …, xn⟩ in {0,1}n, let us define x overall to be the option that is correct for the largest number of voters: • x overall = 1 if there are more voters with xi = 1 than with xi = 0; • x overall = 0 if there are more voters with xi = 0 than with xi = 1; • x overall = 1/2 if there as many voters with xi = 0 as with x i = 1. We are now in a position to describe a generalized jury theorem. We call it a “conjectured theorem” rather than a “theorem,” because we are giving only an informal gloss instead of a full mathematical treatment and provide only a partial proof. An earlier variant, which establishes essentially the same conclusion, was proved by miller (1986). The present result makes the simplifying assumption that although the proportion of voters with different voter‐specific truths is unknown, it is fixed and does not depend on the total number of voters n. Let us say that a profile of voter‐specific truths ⟨x1, x2, …, x n⟩ is proportional to ⟨q, 1 – q⟩ (where 0 ≤ q ≤ 1) if a proportion of q of the individuals i have xi = 1 and a proportion of 1 – q have x i = 0. Conjectured generalized jury theorem: For each pair of proportions ⟨q, 1  –  q⟩ (with q ≠ ½), the probability Pr(V = x overall | X 1 = x1 & X2 = x2 & … & X n = xn), where ⟨x 1, x 2, …, x n⟩ is a profile of voter‐specific truths proportional to ⟨q, 1 – q⟩, usually increases and converges to 1 as the total number n of voters increases.vii In what follows, we give a sketch proof of the asymptotic part of this claim, while not giving a proof of the non‐asymptotic part. We also offer some numerical illustrations of 224 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem both parts. Less technically inclined readers should feel free to skip section 4 and move on straight to section 5. 4 Sketch Proof of the Asymptotic Part Let q and 1 – q be some given proportions of voters i with voter‐specific truths 1 and 0, respectively (where q ≠ ½). Let N = N1 ∪ N 0 be the smallest electorate such that the sizes of N1 and N0 are proportional to q and 1 – q, where N 1 = {i : X i = 1} and N0 = {i : X i = 0}. Let n 1 and n0 be the sizes of N1 and N0, respectively. now construct a sequence of electorates on the basis of this electorate, with the follow- ing sizes: • 1st electorate: total size n, consisting of n1 voters i with Xi = 1 and n0 voters i with Xi = 0; • 2nd electorate: total size 2n, consisting of 2n 1 voters i with X i = 1 and 2n 0 voters i with X i = 0; • 3rd electorate: total size 3n, consisting of 3n1 voters i with Xi = 1 and 3n0 voters i with X i = 0; and so on.viii In each of these electorates, under the assumptions of core voter competence and core voter independence, the expected proportions of votes in support of the two options are as follows: • expected proportion of votes in favor of option 1: (pn1 + (1 – p)n0)/n, • expected proportion of votes in favor of option 0: (pn0 + (1 – p)n1)/n, where p is the competence parameter. Statistically, we expect the following majority decision: • V = 1 if and only if (pn1 + (1 – p)n0)/n > (pn0 + (1 – p)n1)/n, i.e., if and only if n1 > n 0; • V = 0 if and only if (pn0 + (1 – p)n1)/n > (pn1 + (1 – p)n0)/n, i.e., if and only if n0 > n 1. In each case, the simplification of the inequation works because p > ½. In other words, the expected decision is in favor of the option that is best for the largest number of voters (i.e., V = x overall, assuming this is 0 or 1). The law of large numbers implies that, with probability one, the actual proportions of votes for the two options will approximate the expected ones as the size of the electorate kn increases (along the sequence of electorates we have constructed). By implication, Pr(V = x overall | X1 = x1 & X2 = x2 & … & Xkn = xkn), where ⟨x 1, x2, …, xkn⟩ is a profile of voter‐specific truths for the kth electorate along the constructed sequence, converges to one as k (and thereby kn) increases. ix As in the case of the classical jury theorem, when we move from an odd‐sized electorate to a slightly larger even‐sized one, there can be small decreases in the majority competence, due to the possibility of ties. The qualification “usually” in the statement of the result TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 225 signals this complication as well as the fact that, in the limiting case p = 1, the majority competence is constantly 1 and hence we can only speak of a “weak” increase. This completes our sketch proof. 5 Numerical Illustrations of the Generalized Jury Theorem We now provide some numerical examples to illustrate the implications of the generalized jury theorem. In each example, we begin with an initial electorate of size n = n1 + n0, where n 1 and n0 are the numbers of voters with voter‐specific truths 1 and 0, respectively. We scale up this electorate by doubling, tripling, quadrupling its size, and so on, using scaling factors k = 1, 2, 3, 4, …, thereby generating electorates of sizes 1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, … For each k, we calculate the probability of success Pr(V = x overall | X1 = x1 & X2 = x2 & … & Xkn = xkn), understood as the probability that the option that is correct for most voters wins. For small electorates, this probability can be calculated analytically, applying a modified ver- sion of the well‐known standard binomial cumulative distribution function to calculate group competence in a condorcet jury setting. For larger electorates, analytical calcula- tions are computationally too demanding, and approximations provide reliable estimates instead. We omit the technical details. The first example begins with an initial electorate of size n = n1 + n0, where n 1 = 2 and n 0 = 1. Figure 10.1 shows the probability of a majority vote for option 1, the option that is “correct” for most voters, for different multipliers of the electorate k = 1, 2, …, 100 and 20Pr(V=xoverall) 0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 40 60 n1 = 2, n0 =1 p = 0.6 p = 0.7 p = 0.8 k 80 100 Figure 10.1 The probability of a majority vote for option 1 where n1 = 2 and n0 = 1. 226 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem three different values of the individual competence parameter p. The little triangles indi- cate the results for odd values of kn, the lozenges for even values of kn. The probability of success increases in kn (for both odd and even values) and does so faster for higher values of p. Since even‐sized electorates experience more majority ties, the probability of success tends to be lower for them than for comparable odd‐sized electorates, but this difference vanishes as the electorate grows bigger. The second example begins with an initial electorate of size n = n1 + n0, where n1 = 3 and n 0 = 2. As the ratio n1 : n0 is now lower (3 : 2 rather than 2 : 1), the increase in the overall probability of success is a little slower, as shown in Figure 10.2. To illustrate that the convergence result holds even when n 1 and n0 are almost of the same size (so that that there is only a narrow majority of voter‐specific truths on one side) and even when individual competence is barely better than random, we finally present results for n1 = 10 and n0 = 9 with lower levels of p. Figure 10.3 shows the relevant numer- ical approximations. 6 What Happens if Individual Competence Depends on the Voter‐Specific Truth? So far, we have made the simplifying assumption that each voter’s competence does not depend on his or her voter‐specific truth. Specifically, we have assumed that, for each profile of voter‐specific truths, all voters have the same probability of believing their own voter‐specific truth, irrespective of whether that truth is 1 or 0. What happens if we lift 20Pr(V=xoverall) 0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 40 60 n1 = 3, n0 =2 p = 0.6 p = 0.7 p = 0.8 k 80 100 Figure 10.2 The probability of a majority vote for option 1 where n1 = 3 and n0 = 2. TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 227 that assumption? It may be harder, for example, to identify one’s voter‐specific truth if it is 1 than if it is 0, or vice versa. It may be harder for people who have a true interest in social reform, for instance, to recognize their voter‐specific truth than it is for people who have an interest in preserving the status quo. (As an aside, it is often said that there are a significant number of voters in the united States who vote for the republicans even though this is arguably against their economic interests.) So, let us now assume that voters with different voter‐specific truths can have different levels of competence. Formally: Asymmetric core voter competence: For each voter i and each possible profile of voter‐specific truths ⟨x1, x2, …, xn⟩ in {0,1}n, Pr(V i = xi | X1 = x1 & X2 = x2 & … & Xn = xn) exceeds ½ and equals p1 whenever i’s voter‐specific truth is 1 and p0 whenever i’s voter‐ specific truth is 0, where p1 and p0 need not be the same. Here p1 and p0 are the competence parameters for voters with voter‐specific truths 1 and 0, respectively. As before, we assume that p1 and p0 do not depend on the size of the elec- torate. consider again an electorate of size n = n1 + n 0, where n 1 and n0 are the numbers of voters with voter‐specific truths 1 and 0. If we continue to assume core voter independ- ence, the expected proportions of votes for the two options are the following: • expected proportion of votes in favor of option 1: (p1n 1 + (1 – p 0)n0)/n, • expected proportion of votes in favor of option 0: (p0n 0 + (1 – p 1)n1)/n. 2000Pr(V=xoverall) 0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 4000 6000 n1 =10, n0 =9 p = 0.51 p = 0.53 p = 0.55 k 8000 10000 Figure 10.3 The probability of a majority vote for option 1 where n1 = 10 and n0 = 9. 228 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem Accordingly, we expect the following majority decision in the limit: • V = 1 if and only if (p 1n1 + (1 – p0)n 0)/n > (p 0n0 + (1 – p1)n1)/n; • V = 0 if and only if (p 0n0 + (1 – p1)n 1)/n > (p 1n1 + (1 – p0)n0)/n. Simplifying, we get: • V = 1 if and only if (p 1 – ½)/(p 0 – ½) > n0/n1; x • V = 0 if and only if (p 1 – ½)/(p 0 – ½) < n0/n1. So, in the case of asymmetric voter competence, whether we expect a decision for option 1 or for option 0 in the limit depends on whether the ratio of the differences between each of the two competence parameters (p 1 and p0) and ½ is greater or smaller than the ratio between n 0 and n 1. Again, we refer readers to miller (1986) for similar and additional results. (note that we do not expect stable convergence of the decision to either 1 or 0 when (p 1 – ½)/(p0 – ½) = n 0/n1.) For example, let option 1 be the progressive option, and let option 0 be the conserva- tive option. Suppose that p 1 is 0.6, while p0 is 0.8. Here, it is easier for people with a conservative interest to identify their voter‐specific truth than it is for people with a pro- gressive interest. The ratio of the differences between each of the two competence param- eters and ½ is (0.6 – ½)/(0.8 – ½) = 1/3. In this example, we would expect a progressive decision in the limit only if 1/3 > n 0/n1, that is, only if there are more than three times as many people with progressive interests as there are people with conservative interests. By contrast, we would expect a conservative decision in the limit as soon as the number of people with conservative interests exceeds a third of the number of people with progres- sive interests. Therefore, it is no longer generally true that the option that is correct for the largest number of voters will prevail in a large electorate. In fact, under the present assumptions about asymmetric core voter competence, when there are more people for whom the pro- gressive option is correct than people for whom the conservative option is correct but not more than three times as many, the contrary is the case: the option that is wrong for the largest number of voters will prevail. 7 Concluding Remarks Let us conclude by situating Goldman’s thesis in the broader debate on epistemic and procedural conceptions of democracy. According to an epistemic conception of democ- racy, there exists a decision‐procedure‐independent truth as to which option is the correct one in any given decision; the goal of a good democratic decision is to track that truth. If all goes well, the outcome of a democratic procedure – say, majority voting – is indica- tive of the truth in question. According to a procedural conception of democracy, by contrast, there exists no such procedure‐independent truth. rather, the “correctness” of any decision depends on its having been made by the appropriate procedure. Here, the TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 229 outcome of a democratic procedure, if it has the right procedural virtues, is constitutive of what counts as the right decision. xi The classical condorcet jury theorem rests not only on an epistemic conception of democracy, but on a particularly demanding one. The truth as to which option is cor- rect is assumed to be independent not just of the relevant decision procedure, but also of the identity of the individual voters. In a criminal jury, this is plausible. Whether or not the defendant is truly guilty has nothing to do with who the jurors are. Indeed, in a good criminal‐justice system, we hope that we will end up with the same verdict in a given trial, irrespective of the composition of the jury. even more importantly, the fact about which verdict is substantively just does not change when the composition of the jury changes. Alvin Goldman suggests an interesting departure from this picture in democratic contexts (which is consistent with miller’s generalization of condorcet’s framework). While, in effect, he retains the assumption that there is a procedure‐independent criterion as to what the “correct” decision is, he allows this criterion to depend on the identity of the voters. Fundamentally, for Goldman, it is each individual voter for whom there exists a procedure‐independent answer as to what the “correct” or “best” outcome would be. There is no exogenous answer that is true across all voters, independently of who they are. This, however, does not mean that Goldman adopts a procedural, non‐epistemic conception of democracy. In Goldman’s picture, there is still an indirect, derivative sense in which there exists an “overall” truth about the correct outcome for the electorate in aggregate. This “overall” truth is determined, of course, by the profile of voter‐specific truths and therefore depends on the identity of the electorate. Formally, each profile of voter‐specific truths induces – via an appropriate normative criterion (for Goldman, the majority) – a corre- sponding electorate‐dependent truth about the correct outcome in aggregate. But this electorate‐dependent truth is still independent of the voting procedure used. For this reason, Goldman’s conception of democracy qualifies as “epistemic”. crucially, for Goldman, unlike for condorcet, individual votes need not express judg- ments on what is “correct” or “best” for the electorate as a whole. rather, each vote expresses a judgment on what is “correct” or “best” for the individual who casts it. Votes are thus answers to the core voter question, not answers to a question about the correct outcome in aggregate. yet, as we have seen, under the idealized assumptions of core voter competence and core voter independence, democracy can still end up tracking the induced overall truth. Of course, given the demandingness of this result’s assumptions, some caution is needed. Things can easily go wrong when different voter‐specific truths lead to different levels of competence (the asymmetric case we have considered). And as discussed in the existing literature on the condorcet jury theorem, matters can become worse when the conditions of competence or independence are violated more significantly. Goldman’s thesis makes salient an important ambiguity in existing democratic ballot- ing procedures (see also Wolff 1994). Voters are usually given a ballot paper that merely asks them to tick a box next to one of the candidates’ or parties’ names. They are not usu- ally told which question they are supposed to answer. Should they answer the question: 230 TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem (1) “Which candidate or party would be best from my own perspective?” Or should they answer the question: (2) “Which candidate or party would be best from the perspective of society as a whole, allowing for the fact that this perspective may differ from my own?” In the first case, voters would be asked to answer what Goldman calls the “core voter question.” Different people’s votes would express answers to different questions: the core voter questions for different people. In the second case, voters would be asked to answer a single, voter‐independent question. Here, different votes would express different answers to the same question. (needless to say, (1) and (2) do not exhaust the possibilities; we focus on these two only because they help us illustrate the difference between condorcet’s and Goldman’s assumptions.) Goldman’s thesis, as well as its condorcetian generalization in line with miller’s anal- ysis, assumes case (1). condorcet’s original jury theorem, as exemplified by a criminal‐ jury or expert‐panel setting, assumes case (2). each approach is internally consistent and appropriate for a different set of decision problems, but we must not conflate or mix the two. If we wish to benefit from the lessons of either approach, we must keep this point in mind and disambiguate balloting procedures appropriately. Notes i This chapter goes back to a personal correspondence that one of us (christian List) had with Alvin Goldman more than a decade ago. We jointly explored the issue further after a seminar discussion with him at the London School of economics in 2012. We wish to express our admi- ration for Alvin Goldman’s work and our gratitude to him for many interesting conversations, insights, and advice over the years. We are also very grateful to Franz Dietrich for helpful written comments on this chapter. As we were finalizing it, a much earlier paper by nicholas miller came to our attention (miller 1986), which addresses essentially the same problem that we discuss here (though obviously not in relation to Goldman’s 1999 book) and arrives at essen- tially the same formal results. Although there are a number of technical and expositional differ- ences, miller’s results are clearly prior to ours, and we have added references to miller’s paper in several relevant places. We hope the present chapter will also help to reinvigorate interest in miller’s very nice paper. Finally, we acknowledge our use of the open‐source matplotlib library and thank its developers for providing this resource. ii In principle, one could extend this by requiring the voter justifiably to believe the true answer to the core voter question, but we set this aside. iii We assume that each of the two possible values of X occurs with non‐zero probability. iv To be precise, this statement holds, separately, for all odd numbers n and all even numbers n. When we move from n to n + 1, where n is odd and consequently n + 1 is even, there are usually small decreases in the majority competence, due to the possibility of ties. The word “usually” in the statement of the theorem signals this complication as well as the fact that there is only a “weak” increase in the special case p = 1, where the probability of a correct decision is always one. v On the relaxation of voter competence, see, among others, Grofman et al. (1983) and Boland (1989). On the relaxation of voter independence, see especially Ladha (1992), Dietrich and List (2004), and Dietrich and Spiekermann (2013). TH e c O n DO r ce T jur y TH e O rem 231 vi To ensure that the conditional probabilities to which we have referred are well‐defined, we must either assume that each possible profile of voter‐specific truths, ⟨x1, x 2, …, x n⟩, occurs with non‐zero probability, or treat the relevant conditional probabilities as primitives (rather than as derived from underlying unconditional probabilities). vii note that the assumption q ≠ ½ excludes the “knife‐edge” case in which x overall = ½. The qual- ification “usually” is to be understood in analogy to the one in our statement of the classical jury theorem above. viii In this construction, the variables V1, V2, V 3, … and X1, X2, X3, … are not assumed to be the same for all electorates in the sequence. rather, for each new electorate in the sequence, we consider a new pair of sets of variables V 1, V2, …, V kn and X 1, X2, …, Xkn, where kn is the size of the electorate in question. The different electorates in the sequence have in common only the proportions q and 1 – q of voters with voter‐specific truths 1 and 0. If one wanted to make this explicit, one could index the variables by indicating the relevant electorate as a superscript, as in V k1, V k2, …, V kkn and X k1, Xk2, …, X kkn. ix note that we have excluded the “knife‐edge” case n 1 = n0. x To see this, note the equivalence between (i) p 1n 1 + (1  –  p0)n0 > p0n 0 + (1  –  p1)n1; (ii) p1n1  –  (1 – p 1)n 1 > p0n0 – (1 – p0)n0; (iii) (2p1 – 1)n1 > (2p 0 – 1)n0; and (iv) (p 1 – ½)/(p0 – ½) > n 0/n1. xi For a discussion, see, for example, List and Goodin (2001).

In their characteristically lucid fashion, christian List and Kai Spiekermann have articulated the central points in my chapter, “Democracy,” from Knowledge in a Social World (Goldman 1999), and then proceeded to transcend them. The technical prowess of their treatment far exceeds anything in the original. The core ideas from the chapter are readily discernible; yet there is much that is new and interesting. I thank christian for his early pinpointing of what was fresh in that chapter – relative to the tradition – and for carrying the ball further now in insightful new directions. my chapter barely mentioned the condorcet jury theorem (cjT), but their current chapter draws the connection very clearly. In my response here, little space is devoted to cjT specifically. The original chapter’s core idea is that majoritarian procedure, all by itself, does not guarantee an electorate any sort of democratically desirable outcomes. Success in (recog- nizably) democratic terms also depends on voters’ knowledge states. In particular, what the voters know or fail to know about the outcome set that each candidate would generate (if elected) is crucial. Specifically, my model assumes a binary electoral contest in which one of the two candidates, if elected, would produce an objectively better (total) outcome than the other would produce. more specifically, unlike many classical political theorists, I do not assume that any particular outcome‐set would be objectively better than its alternative for every voter. Instead I assume that one possible outcome‐set would be objectively better than another relative to a given voter. This objective superiority relation is a function of the specified voter’s preferences. next it is pointed out that if a voter V has a true belief about which candidate would produce the better outcome‐set (for her), then she will vote for that candidate. And if a majority of such voters, all with relevantly accurate information of the same kind (“core voter knowledge”), vote accordingly, there will be what I call a “demo- cratically successful outcome.” under the proposed success criterion, a collective decision reply to List and Spiekermann re PL y T O   LIST A n D   SPI e K erm A nn 233 is best (overall) when it is best from the perspective of the largest number of voters. It isn’t essential that the same outcome‐set be best for every voter. As List and Spiekermann express it, there is a majoritarian relationship between any given profile of voter‐specific truths and the induced, derivative “truth” as to which option is correct overall. now let the core voter question (cVQ) be: “Which candidate, if elected, would produce the better outcome‐set from my point of view?” If every voter believes the true answer to this sort of question, and votes accordingly, the answer that is correct for the largest number of voters will receive the most votes and the indicated candidate will be elected. even if only a large enough number of voters are competent (rather than all of them), there is a substantial prob- ability that the “correct” candidate will be selected and a “democratically successful” outcome will ensue. In the List–Spiekermann paper, the apparatus of the condorcet jury theorem is now introduced, and they generate more precise formulations of the probabilities for demo- cratic success under varying assumptions of voter competence. (See their chapter for details.) At this point (late in their chatper) they introduce a very interesting new idea – and threat to democratic success. Suppose we drop the assumption that voters all have the same competence as one another, irrespective of which truth is their voter‐specific truth. Suppose it is easier for people with a conservative interest to identify their voter‐specific truth than it is for people with a progressive interest to identify their voter‐specific truth. In short, there is asymmetric core‐voter competence. List and Spiekermann show that such asymmetry can easily yield the result that options that are best for the largest number of voters may no longer prevail. This opens a new window into a disturbing possibility: that asymmetric competence can lead to “wrong” results. Such an asymmetry could arise from various epistemic forces in the political realm, which the social epistemology of democracy should certainly address (on another occasion). Finally, a fundamental theoretical issue in democratic theory deserves mention here, con- cerning the tight link I have made between democracy and majority rule. The aforementioned criterion for democratic success is unabashedly majoritarian. An electoral outcome is said to be a democratic “success” only if the winner is deemed best by the largest number of voters. But does this constitute “genuine democracy”? Ben Saunders (2010), for one, disagrees. He discusses the matter in terms of procedures rather than outcomes; but his point should be clear even if it is posed in these terms. In a procedure called “lottery voting,” each person casts a vote for their favored option. But, rather than the option with the most votes automatically winning, a single vote is selected randomly, and it determines the outcome. This procedure is arguably democratic, argues Saunders, since all members of the community have a chance to influence the outcome; but it is not majority rule, since a vote by a member of the minority may well be picked. This procedure might be democratically superior, Saunders argues, because it allows persistent minorities to win some of the time, whereas majority‐biased procedures may render that upshot impossible. This is an interesting issue, though tangential to our main discussion. References Goldman, A. (1999). Knowledge in a Social World. Oxford university Press, Oxford. Saunders, Ben (2010).

Knowledge and Reliability Jennife R n agel 11 Great theories can have counterintuitive consequences. When intuition clashes with theory, sometimes the best course is not to reject the theory but to argue that something is wrong with the intuition. This chapter examines the best‐known intuitive counter­ examples that have been pressed against Alvin Goldman’s reliabilist theory of knowledge, and argues that something is wrong with them. Under close scrutiny, the scenarios that internalists take to undercut reliabilism are ambiguous. Interestingly enough, on either way of resolving the ambiguity, these scenarios fail to present us with clear instances of unjustified but reliably formed belief. In what follows, I argue that on the most natural way of reading the internalist cases, the beliefs they invite us to evaluate are not in fact reliably formed: although the cases describe a series of true judgments, these judgments only happen to be true, and are not the products of a process that tends to hit the truth in the way that reliabilism requires. With some effort, it is possible to find a way of constru­ ing the cases so that the relevant beliefs actually are reliably formed; however, this way of reading the cases makes it difficult to conduct an intuitive evaluation of the justification of those beliefs, for reasons having to do with certain natural limitations on our ability to track the mental states of others. The intuitive appeal of the internalist cases arises in part from their ability to coax us into a self‐conscious frame of mind in which it is difficult to judge less self‐conscious belief formation with appropriate accuracy. Although the main aim of this chapter is to argue that our intuitions do not tell against reliabilism, a concluding section discusses the possibility that these intuitions might accord equally well with a more extreme externalist view, Williamson’s “knowledge‐first” approach. The chapter does not attempt to adjudicate between these programs; however, it observes that the move used against the internalist cases on behalf of reliabilism in the first half of the chapter is quite similar to a move that could be used against reliabilism by 238 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y an advocate of the more radical knowledge‐first view. If the illicit intuitive appeal of the internalist cases is traced back to the distorting influence of a certain self‐conscious frame of mind, this same self‐conscious frame of mind can also be identified as a factor that would push us towards a belief‐centered epistemological theory such as reliabilism, and away from the knowledge‐first approach. reliabilism has been examined largely in con­ trast to internalism, but its strengths and weaknesses arguably come into sharper focus if we compare it with more radical forms of externalism as well. 1 Intuitive Counterexamples to Reliabilism? not just any true belief counts as knowledge. The core idea of Goldman’s original reliabil­ ist theory of knowledge is that a true belief attains the status of knowledge just when it is produced by a reliable cognitive mechanism, where reliability is understood to consist in a tendency to produce true beliefs (Goldman 1976). There is something appealing about the idea that there is a modal connection between truth and knowledge: the person who knows does not merely happen to get it right on this occasion, but somehow thinks in a way that has some deeper tendency to hit the truth. Many worries have been raised about the details of reliabilism, about the question of how exactly the relevant cognitive mechanisms are to be individuated, or what should count as reliability or a tendency to hit the truth. but one of the earliest and best‐known lines of attack on reliabilism challenges the position’s core commitment: according to internalists, no matter how we flesh out the details, we will be missing something impor­ tant about knowledge if we retain reliabilism’s singular focus on tending to get things right. What is missing, according to the internalist, is a special place for the subject’s point of view in the generation of knowledge. In support of this view, internalists have developed several well‐known cases in which subjects with a strong tendency to be right about some­ thing lack accessible evidence of this tendency: they make accurate judgments without being in a position to know or even reasonably judge that they are reliable. Intuitively, these blindly accurate subjects seem to lack knowledge. Close examination of the exact formulation of a sample of these cases may help us to figure out why we respond to them as we do. The first example is bonJour’s psychic case, originally presented in (bonjour 1980), but more recently clarified and rephrased as follows: Suppose then that Amanda is a reliable clairvoyant under certain specific conditions with respect to a particular range of subject matter. owing perhaps to some sort of causal process that has so far eluded scientific investigators, beliefs about that subject matter now and then occur spontaneously and forcefully to Amanda under those conditions and such beliefs are mostly or even perhaps invariably true. Amanda, however, though she generally accepts the beliefs in question, has never checked empirically to see whether any of them are true, nor has the potentially available empirical evidence for the truth of any of the specific claims and in consequence for her general reliability been supplied to her by others. (bonJour and Sosa 2003: 28) kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 239 bonJour concludes that beliefs formed in this manner could not constitute knowledge. Considering an elaboration of the case in which it is explicitly added that the subject lacks any reason to think she is unreliable, bonJour contends that this subject “is still being epistemically irrational and irresponsible in accepting beliefs whose provenance can only be a total mystery to her, whose status is as far as she can tell no different from that of a stray hunch or arbitrary conviction” (2003: 32). A broadly similar case was developed by keith lehrer: Suppose a person, whom we shall name Mr. Truetemp, undergoes brain surgery by an experimental surgeon who invents a small device which is both a very accurate ther­ mometer and a computational device capable of generating thoughts. The device, call it a tempucomp, is implanted in Truetemp’s head so that the very tip of the device, no larger than the head of a pin, sits unnoticed on his scalp and acts as a sensor to transmit information about the temperature to the computational system of his brain. This device, in turn, sends a message to his brain causing him to think of the temperature recorded by the external sensor. Assume that the tempucomp is very reliable, and so his thoughts are correct temperature thoughts. All told, this is a reliable belief‐forming process. now imagine, finally, that he has no idea that the tempucomp has been inserted in his brain, is only slightly puzzled about why he thinks so obsessively about the temperature, but never checks a thermometer to determine whether these thoughts about the temperature are correct. He accepts them unreflectively, another effect of the tempucomp. Thus, he thinks and accepts that the temperature is 104 degrees. It is. does he know that it is? Surely not. (lehrer 1990: 163–4) When a temperature thought occurs to Mr. Truetemp, lehrer continues, “he has no idea why the thought occurred to him or that such thoughts are almost always correct. He does not, consequently, know that the temperature is 104 degrees when the thought occurs to him” (1990, 164). There is something intuitively compelling about these cases: Amanda and Truetemp are perfectly accurate reporters with respect to some special subject matter, but it is at the very least controversial whether their mysterious accuracy is enough for knowledge. If reliabilism were the right theory, bonJour and lehrer contend, then these cases should come across as clear examples of knowledge, but they do not. Goldman himself reports sharing the internalist intuition that Amanda and Truetemp lack knowledge (1994). He volunteers an error theory to deflect the challenge posed by these cases: according to Goldman, our natural intuitions about knowledge and justifica­ tion are generated by a two‐step process in which particular cases are compared to famil­ iar prototypes of good and bad belief formation. If a case closely matches a good type (whether perceptual, memorial or inferential), we evaluate it positively; if it matches a bad type, or simply fails to match any recognized type, we evaluate it negatively. Goldman further proposes that the underlying prototypes are divided into good and bad types according to their reliability. The cognitive workings of Amanda and Truetemp are pecu­ liar enough that their judgments fail to match any familiar positive prototype; however, according to Goldman, this result does not directly indicate that these judgments lack the feature that fundamentally matters to positive epistemic status. reliability is what 240 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y really matters in epistemic evaluation; indeed, it is because Amanda and Truetemp simply lack the familiar signs of reliability that our rough intuitive mechanisms assess them negatively. Goldman grants to the internalists that Amanda and Mr. Truetemp are actually reliable in their belief formation, albeit reliable in a confusingly unfamiliar way. In his view these cases come across negatively because intuition only tests for reliability indirectly, via com­ parison to its familiar manifestations. This is an interesting suggestion, but it leaves certain questions unanswered. Goldman does not contend that Mr. Truetemp’s thinking comes close to matching some “vice” prototype of bad belief formation; his claim is rather that Mr. Truetemp’s thinking simply fails to match what Goldman takes to be the closest positive prototypes, prototypes of perception (1992, 1994). It fails to match in virtue of the stipulated absence of any conscious sensory phenomenology. What Goldman does not explain is why exactly we would have a negative intuitive response to such cases, as opposed to a failure to respond intuitively one way or the other. i Goldman claims, plausibly enough, that closely matching a prototypically “vicious” mode of belief formation (like wishful thinking) would result in the intuitive sense that a belief is unjustified, but it is not obvious that sheer failure to match a positive prototype should have a similar effect. one might have thought that we would simply have no clear intuitive response to belief‐forming processes which were neither close to virtue‐prototypes nor close to vice‐ prototypes; Goldman does not explain why our default response would be negative, rather than blank, or even positive. Some background pressure towards a positive evaluation could arguably arise from our general psychological inclination to over‐attribute knowledge, espe­ cially to those who are forming beliefs we know to be true (on this point, see, for example, nickerson 1999). Indeed Goldman himself is somewhat tentative in his line on these cases: having made an initial claim that failure to match a positive prototype will make it intuitive that a belief is unjustified, Goldman later says more conservatively that failure to match will generate “a certain measure of reluctance to judge that the belief is justified” (1994: 315). If we feel not just reluctance to evaluate positively, but something decidedly negative towards the belief formation of Amanda and Mr. Truetemp, perhaps reliabilists need a stronger explanation of why this is so. The most direct way of defending reliabilism against these cases would be to deny that they are counterexamples to the theory in the first place: perhaps the subjects of these cases, as we most naturally understand them, are actually unreliable in their belief formation. It may seem like obtuse resistance to stipula­ tion to say such a thing, but in what follows I’ll argue that, despite the involvement of some reliable components in their thinking, each of these subjects is most naturally evalu­ ated as forming beliefs in an unreliable manner. The reason for this is that both cases prompt us to think of the subject’s belief‐formation as though it were self‐conscious, while simultaneously stipulating that these subjects are violating a core condition on reliable self‐conscious belief formation. The intuitively unjustified belief in these cases is not reliably formed. The power of the cases is secured in part by certain intuitive difficul­ ties in representing unselfconscious belief formation, but I will argue that the cases fail to show that unselfconscious belief formation is intuitively unjustified; they also fail to show that the core condition of reliable self‐conscious belief formation is a condition of either reliable belief formation or justified belief formation in general. kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 241 2 Believing and Accepting The Amanda and Truetemp examples share a common feature: each of the cases describes the subject as passing through a stage of acceptance, where this stage is distinct from the reliable psychic or tempucomp‐driven process that supplies the propositional content to be judged. In the Truetemp case the division between these stages is particularly clear: the tempucomp generates accurate thoughts about the tem­ perature, and then, although Mr. Truetemp is puzzled by the intrusion of these odd thoughts, “he accepts them unreflectively, another effect of the tempucomp.” Paying close attention to lehrer’s description of the case, we see that the belief‐forming pro­ cess is not complete when the original temperature thoughts are generated: lehrer characterizes the device as “causing [Truetemp] to think of the temperature recorded by the external sensor,” but thinking of something is not the same as believing that something is so. Many attitudes other than outright belief are compatible with enter­ taining a given thought about the temperature. Although lehrer says of the first stage that it is “all told … a reliable belief‐forming process,” it is not until he mentions Mr. Truetemp’s unreflective acceptance of the thoughts about the temperature that lehrer actually characterizes Mr. Truetemp as endorsing those thoughts, attributing to Mr. Truetemp a belief that the temperature is 104 degrees. Here the reliabilist might wonder whether our negative intuitions about the case are being generated by the pivotal second stage of Mr. Truetemp’s judgment – his “unreflective acceptance” of the puzzling intrusive thoughts. If, as will shortly be argued, this kind of unreflective acceptance is naturally seen as an unreliable method of belief formation, then the whole process that terminates in Mr. Truetemp’s endorsement of a proposition about the temperature is not a reliable one. The fact that the surgeon’s manipulation pro­ duces a string of true beliefs in Mr. Truetemp does not ensure that these beliefs are being generated by a reliable process: reliability is a modal notion, and not a diachronic one. What matters as far as reliabilism is concerned is not simply whether Mr. Truetemp’s many temperature beliefs are true, but whether they are generated by the kind of process that tends to produce true beliefs. bonJour’s cases feature a similar emphasis on what is accepted: Amanda does not simply form spontaneous beliefs, but in addition it is stipulated that “she generally accepts the beliefs in question,” notwithstanding her lack of accessible evidence for their truth or for her own reliability. We are told something about why Amanda initially forms the beliefs – some odd causal process produces them – but we are not told exactly why she subsequently accepts those beliefs, although we are given reasons to worry that something is seriously amiss with whatever processes are operative at the stage of acceptance. Indeed, for Amanda as for Mr. Truetemp there is some reason to wonder whether the initial (pre‐acceptance) stage is more easily seen as a stage in which ideas simply come to mind, rather than a stage in which full‐blown beliefs are already formed: when we read that “beliefs about that subject matter now and then occur spontaneously and forcefully to Amanda,” it is easy to imagine her as just experiencing some moments of inner speech, or visual imagery, or something along those lines, and not entirely obvious that what she has at this stage are already the beliefs whose legitimacy we are to evaluate. 242 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y If subjects like Amanda and Mr. Truetemp do not even seem to have outright beliefs until they engage in acceptance or endorsement, then the truth‐conduciveness of those processes of acceptance or endorsement will have to matter to the reliabilist evaluation of their beliefs. but even if these subjects are already seen as having beliefs prior to the acceptance stage, if we are cued to evaluate the legitimacy of these subjects’ beliefs only after the acceptance stage, then the contribution of the latter stage can still make a differ­ ence in our appraisals. on the latter understanding of the cases, there is some potential for confusion about what is meant by expressions like “the subject’s belief ”: we might use that expression to pick out either Amanda’s initial mysterious impression or her subse­ quent endorsement of that impression. but any tendency to apply the same phrase as a label for either stage of Amanda’s thinking should not be allowed to obscure the differ­ ences between them: if different cognitive processes underpin the two stages, then they can receive different epistemic evaluations from the reliabilist. As Goldman has stressed – for example, in his (1979) – what matters in reliabilist epistemic evaluation is not simply the reliability of the process that originally produced a belief, but rather the reliability of the complete set of processes responsible for sustaining the belief through to the moment of evaluation. To complicate matters further, there seems to be a larger ambiguity about the role played by acceptance in the internalist examples: a phase of acceptance might be seen as either actual or potential with respect to the formation of the belief to be evaluated, either as a causally necessary part of the formation of that belief, or as a merely hypothetical stage that the subject might pass through without alteration to the key belief ’s epistemic standing. In the latter way of reading the cases, the acceptance stage is not itself a part of the formation of the intuitively unjustified belief, but one potential diagnostic maneuver we can imagine the subject going through in order to reveal the epistemic faults of the original belief. It will be argued that either way of understanding of the role of acceptance will generate problems; because the problems are somewhat different, however, they will be examined separately. 3 Evaluating the Moment of Acceptance We can first examine the consequences of taking the subject’s acceptance as a causally necessary part of the formation of the beliefs we are supposed to evaluate. on this way of reading the cases, prior to acceptance the subjects may have some state of mind falling short of belief, or they may have some initial beliefs which are then actually endorsed by the subject in a way we are invited to evaluate. either way, our focus will be on the subject’s epistemic standing following the stage of endorsement or acceptance, keeping in mind that the epistemic characteristics of this stage might differ from those of the initial impression. According to the reliabilist, Mr. Truetemp could be doing well when he forms his initial thought or belief that the temperature is 104 degrees, but doing badly when he subse­ quently accepts this thought or belief in the absence of any consciously available reasons. If the reliabilist wants to argue that Mr. Truetemp’s acceptance of his accurate thoughts will not be reliable, the challenge now is to explain what it is about acceptance that would kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 243 make acceptance in the absence of consciously available reasons unreliable. A closer look at acceptance is in order. Although the odd psychic and tempucomp‐driven elements in Amanda and Mr. Truetemp’s thinking are novel, I think acceptance is something more familiar; indeed its familiarity contributes substantially to the psychological realism of the cases, helping to engage our capacity for intuitive epistemic evaluation. At least as the term is used in these cases, “accepting” is not interchangeable with “believing.” lehrer himself spells out a positive theory of what he takes to be the charac­ ter of acceptance, characterizing it as a particular type of purposive attitude formation, demanding the explicit evaluation of a proposition ideally guided by the goal of attaining the truth (1990: 10–11). belief, on his view, is a weaker condition that is not necessarily attained through purposive thinking. Various aspects of lehrer’s way of drawing the contrast are questionable in ways that will not concern us here, but its core idea is that some judgments involve explicit, controlled evaluation – the kind of evaluation we engage in when we carefully weigh evidence for and against a certain hypothesis –while other judgments are made without this kind of attention. The controlled capacity to accept is something higher than the mere capacity to believe: so, for example, nonhuman animals might be seen as having beliefs, but it would be odd – or cutely anthropomorphic – to describe a nonhuman animal as accepting that something was the case. Whether or not lehrer has articulated it in the standard way, there is an easily recog­ nizable psychological distinction in this neighborhood, a distinction which seems to me to play a key role in our understanding of the internalist cases. This is the distinction between the automatic, rapid, and effortless form of thought known as System 1 or type‐1 process­ ing (henceforth S1), and the controlled, explicit and sequential form of thought known as System 2 or type‐2 processing (S2) (for reviews, see Stanovich 1999; Sloman 1996; evans 2008). There is some debate about the right way to draw the line between these two modes of thought, but it is now widely thought that the involvement of working memory is crucial (de neys 2006; evans 2009). because the contents of working memory are gener­ ally available to consciousness (baddeley 2007), S2 processing will make us conscious of a series of relevant contents en route to supplying an answer; S1 processing will not do this. S1 processing – the type of processing involved in ordinary face recognition, for example – operates through automatic mechanisms closed to introspective access. We see someone’s face and immediately recognize her as a friend, but would be hard‐pressed to list the qualities of her features in virtue of which we did so. This type of processing is involuntary; the recognition happens whether or not we want it to happen. Meanwhile, S2 processing – the type of processing involved in complex mental arithmetic, for example – runs through the bottleneck of our limited working memory capacity, and so is slower, but operates in a way that is both more controlled and more open to view. In the characteristically S2 task of long division, for example, we go through a sequence of conscious intermediary steps where the output of each intermediary step supplies input to the next (Sloman 1996; kahneman and Frederick 2005). This kind of thinking is relatively controlled: we can, for example, decide to abandon an S2 task halfway through, say, giving up on the arithmetical exercise and directing our attention elsewhere. The reliability of S2 processing depends on sustaining our focus on the task and running appropriate operations on the consciously available content it presents. 244 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y Crucially, there are some problems to which either type of processing may be applied. So, we naturally compute 5 times 11 automatically and effortlessly, without consciousness of any series of stages, but if we are appropriately motivated we can run through an explicit and sequential verification of this answer digit‐by‐digit. In general, routine, low‐stakes, familiar matters are more likely to be settled in S1; unusual, high‐stakes and novel issues are more likely to elicit S2 thinking. of particular relevance to the internalist cases, the task of source monitoring can be handled either by S1 or S2, where source monitoring is the process by means of which we assess the origin of our mental experiences, attributing a given content to a source such as recent or more distant memory, present sensation of one kind or another, or imagination. For example, when asked about a recently past event (what did you have for breakfast today?) the content that comes to mind needs to be veri­ fied as arising from the appropriate memory store in order to answer the question (Johnson et  al. 1993). Under routine, low‐stakes conditions we verify the source in S1, relying heuristically on the felt degree of vividness in the content and felt ease of retrieval (or familiarity). Source monitoring is a crucial process in belief formation. The confidence of our everyday judgments depends on it: for example, one’s level of confidence in a recalled trivia fact is a function of the fluency with which it is recalled (kelley and lindsay 1993). Indeed, across the board, confidence in typical unselfconscious judgments, including perceptual judgments and social attitudes, is generated heuristically on the basis of meta­ cognitive feedback from one’s cognitive operations, in a way which is generally responsive to their reliability (koriat 2011; koriat and Adiv 2011). However, when made to feel self‐conscious (are you sure that was today’s breakfast, and not yesterday’s?) or placed under high‐stakes conditions (the police are questioning you after a fatal poisoning), one applies more effort to the source‐monitoring problem, for example by deliberately reconstructing the temporal context of the remembered event, assessing its various features for plausibility, and so forth. Whatever our mode of thought  –  whether we are say, remembering, perceiving or inferring  –  peculiarities in activated content, or in its fluency of activation, naturally trigger this more effortful S2 thinking (Alter and oppenheimer 2009; Thompson 2009). This self‐conscious source monitoring provides a useful check on the operations of lower‐level belief formation, both because it is triggered by signals that something may have gone wrong at the lower level, and because the global broadcast of what is in working memory can draw many different sources of potentially relevant information into solving the problem of figuring out what is really going on (Shanahan and baars 2005). The relationship between conscious thinking and reliability is not simple. other things being equal, more cautious and systematic thinking does enhance reliability (koriat and Goldsmith 1996; lerner and Tetlock 1999; Stanovich 1999), but the elevation to S2 is not of course necessary for reliability (so, for example, face recognition is generally accurate notwithstanding its automaticity). Meanwhile, systematic thinking has certain vulnerabil­ ities of its own, for example when we are hasty or unreasonable in our handling of what is consciously available, either because our limited working memory is distracted by other tasks, or because our controlled cognition is controlled in the wrong way, say, swayed by some biasing motivation (kunda 1990). There is no simple correlation between the pres­ ence or absence of S2 processing and the presence or absence of reliability. However, the kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 245 contrast between the two types of thinking can still serve to clarify the reliabilist’s position on the importance of what is available from the first‐person perspective. In evaluating methods of belief formation strictly on the basis of their tendency to produce true beliefs, the reliabilist does not have to rule out any special consideration for first‐person availability. Whenever there is a mode of belief formation whose reliable operation depends on the availability of appropriate material to consciousness, the reliabilist has an obvious reason to insist on the availability of appropriate material to consciousness. If the core character­ istic of S2 thinking is that it operates on material present in working memory (and there­ fore consciously available), then the reliability of those who are engaged in S2 thinking will depend on what is consciously available to them. This psychological background enables a fresh reliabilist interpretation of the inter­ nalist cases. Amanda and Mr. Truetemp find themselves judging  –  or perhaps merely disposed to judge – certain odd propositions to be the case. Given the oddness of these propositions, and the stipulation that the inclination to endorse them arises from no ordi­ nary faculty whose operations might be evaluated in the ordinary heuristic or automatic fashion, it is natural for these subjects to pass through a stage of explicitly or consciously monitoring their judgments. It is perfectly natural to see these subjects as not only having beliefs, but entering a distinct phase of accepting or maintaining them, just as lehrer and bonJour’s descriptions stipulate. We are familiar with this kind of evaluation as a process of weighing consciously available material. In the internalist cases, however, this phase is described as taking place without the help of appropriate consciously available material. because explicit evaluations depend for their reliability on what is consciously available, when Amanda and Mr. Truetemp nonetheless endorse their initial impressions, they are thinking in a way that is not generally reliable. The internalist might protest here that although Amanda and Mr. Truetemp’s practices of acceptance are unusual, these practices have been altered in a way that should shield them from reliabilist criticism. Mr. Truetemp is not described as now generally failing to seek reasons for what he accepts, but quite specifically as a blind accepter of the tempera­ ture thoughts (this pattern of acceptance was described as “another effect” of the tempu­ comp). If these thoughts are simultaneously guaranteed by the tempucomp to be accurate and to be accepted unreflectively, then the surgeon’s manipulation does not really disable or compromise the reliability of Truetemp’s cognition in any significant way, the internal­ ist might contend. Granting that our ordinary ways of monitoring our thinking may be reliable partly in virtue of how they handle what is available to consciousness, the internalist could still insist that even greater reliability could be produced by a special psychological compulsion to endorse the deliverances of a paranormally accurate faculty. Whether this internalist rebuttal can succeed depends in no small measure on the way in which we naturally individuate the relevant belief‐forming mechanisms in reading these cases, and how we see the relationship between the accuracy of the first stage and the operation of the second. one way of deflecting the internalist response here would be to point out that the cases leave open the possibility that it is merely coincidental that the subject has both an accurate faculty and a hard‐wired tendency to accept its deliverances. If there is no necessary connection between the accuracy of the first faculty and the oper­ ation of the second, the overall process is still not of a type that tends to produce true 246 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y beliefs. That is, we might see the final and decisive effect of the tempucomp as forcing Mr. Truetemp to accept just whatever readings the device initially sends him, regardless of their accuracy, so that if his device were to read overly hot or cold he would be equally stuck with the relevant false beliefs. Given that the tempucomp disables his ordinary con­ scious critical capacity as far as the temperature is concerned, he is just lucky that the tempucomp is supplying accurate information on that point. equally, Amanda’s accept­ ance of her paranormally‐formed ideas happens to result in a string of true beliefs, but the character of her acceptance is under‐described. The case leaves it open that we might for example think of her as being inclined to believe the deliverances of any novel faculty, whether or not this faculty tracks the truth; indeed the impression that she is simply gul­ lible might be underscored by bonJour’s emphasis on her epistemic “recklessness and irresponsibility.” She might be like Goldman’s Humperdink, who very capriciously selects what is in fact a good algorithm for solving a class of problems, and then answers every problem in the set accurately: given his initial caprice, his entire belief‐forming process is unreliable, despite its production of a string of true beliefs (Goldman 1979). Amanda’s “algorithm” is a sub‐personal faculty capriciously planted in her, together with a process that disarms her psychologically normal self‐monitoring; the sub‐personal faculty happens to be accurate, but the belief‐forming process as a whole is not reliable. ii Persistent internalists might at this point concede that our intuitions about the original bonJour and lehrer cases could be explained by a sense that the subjects in these particu­ lar cases are thinking in an unreliable manner, but then attempt to devise modified cases in which the accuracy of the first‐stage manipulation is essential to the operation of the second stage. Perhaps the benevolent scientist has designed the tempucomp to compel Mr. Truetemp to accept the temperature thoughts just when the thermometer is reading accurately; some failsafe mechanism will switch it off altogether if the thermometer ever loses accuracy. To make their point against reliabilism, meanwhile, internalists will have to stipulate that the accepting subject still has no consciously available evidence of the accu­ racy of his paranormal belief‐forming process; the process of acceptance will depend perhaps causally on this accuracy, but will not work by making this accuracy available to consciousness. The reliabilist needs a deeper argument to neutralize these revised cases. one possible strategy would be to resist their tacit assumptions about the intuitive individuation of belief‐forming processes. The revised cases assume that the relevant beliefs are formed on the basis of a specially modified process of acceptance which is not governed by con­ sciously accessible content, but not just any process will register as an intuitively imagina­ ble form of acceptance. In the everyday course of our thinking, where our epistemic intuitions have been trained in the first place, the process of acceptance works through the operations it performs on consciously available content. The phenomenal grasp we have on acceptance does in fact capture an essential feature of this way of thinking: as an S2 process, acceptance really does need to operate through manipulations of what is in work­ ing memory. So, if acceptance in the form we will find intuitively recognizable is really going to depend on the accuracy of a lower‐level belief‐forming mechanism, the accuracy of this lower‐level belief‐forming mechanism needs to make itself available to conscious­ ness.iii This is not to say that we would need to have conscious awareness of the fact that kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 247 the lower‐level mechanism is accurate; it would be enough to have the kind of conscious phenomenology that ordinarily serves as a guide to our acceptance of the deliverances of lower‐level mechanisms, the kind of phenomenology that is stipulated to be absent in the internalist cases. As long as we are looking at the relevant process as a form of acceptance, the modal facts around its operation depend on what is available to consciousness – our stipulation that the acceptance will cease if the temperature readings fail to be accurate is arbitrary, as far as the nature of acceptance is concerned; we could equally well have stip­ ulated that the acceptance would cease if the temperature readings were ever anything other than five degrees too hot. Alternatively, there is another reliabilist strategy for managing both these revised cases and the original ones, a more radical strategy which does not insist that the relevant process is actually a form of explicitly reasoned acceptance. This will be explored in the next section. So far, we have been concerned to adopt a reading of the cases on which an explicit process of acceptance is a vital part of the beliefs we are invited to evaluate. because the stage of acceptance involves a kind of thinking whose reliability depends on the conscious availability of appropriate materials, the reliabilist can agree with the internalist that justification in these cases demands the conscious availability of appropriate materials. However, the reliabilist does not need to insist that justification always depends on what is consciously accessible to the subject, exactly because not all belief formation is a function of operations on consciously available material. When beliefs are formed through S1 processing their reliable formation does not necessarily depend on what passes through consciousness. iv In this spirit the reliabilist can draw our attention to the fact that we do not ordinarily demand self‐conscious reflection on the deliverances of perception, memory or testimony in order to see beliefs formed on these bases as justified; the reliabil­ ist can also draw our attention to the threat of vicious regress lurking in such demands (cf. bergmann 2006). According to the reliabilist, there is no special reason to favor relia­ bility‐as‐secured‐by‐consciously‐available‐reasoning over reliability secured otherwise (on this point, see kornblith 2010, 2012). on a reading of the internalist cases which stresses the psychologically distinctive character of conscious acceptance, the reliabilist can happily agree with bonJour’s assessment that a blindly psychic subject would be “epistemically irrational and irresponsible in accepting beliefs whose provenance can only be a total mystery to her,” without conceding that this difficulty at the level of acceptance constitutes any problem for the epistemic status of those original beliefs themselves. There is nothing wrong with blind reliability, even when there would be something wrong with its reflective endorsement. 4 Explicit Acceptance as a Merely Hypothetical Diagnostic Device There is another way to read the internalist cases, however. rather than focusing on the psychological reality of the acceptance stage, and having to grant that the reliabilist can agree that what is consciously available matters there, the internalist might suggest instead that explicit acceptance need not actually figure as a stage in the formation of the beliefs 248 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y we are invited to evaluate. on this reading of the cases, Amanda and Mr. Truetemp are already in trouble at the first stage, when they have formed beliefs on some non‐evidential basis; considering how poorly they would fare on reflection is strictly a hypothetical device, a possible diagnostic measure that might be undertaken to reveal the unacceptabil­ ity of the first‐stage beliefs themselves. on this reading the internalist concedes that we don’t expect everyone to reflect self‐consciously on what they believe at every moment in order to count them as justified; what matters is just the truth of some subjunctive condi­ tional of the form if she were to reflect on this belief, she would have appropriate grounds to endorse it reflectively. Whether or not the subject actually does reflect on or consciously endorse her belief, she can count as justified only if this conditional holds true. In support of this reading of the cases, bonJour might direct our attention to his character norman, who is not initially described as passing through any stage of acceptance: norman, under certain conditions that usually obtain, is a completely reliable clairvoyant with respect to certain kinds of subject matter. He possesses no evidence or reasons of any kind for or against the general possibility of such a cognitive power, or for or against the thesis that he possesses it. one day norman comes to believe that the President is in new york City, though he has no evidence either for or against this belief. In fact the belief is true and results from his clairvoyant power, under circumstances in which it is completely reliable. (bonjour 1980: 62) Immediately after presenting the scenario, bonJour raises the question of whether norman’s belief constitutes knowledge. He does not immediately answer this question, but proceeds to offer two distinct ways of elaborating the case, both of which he takes to support a negative answer. First, he imagines a version of the scenario in which norman further believes without evidence that he has a clairvoyant power like the one he in fact possesses, and that this higher‐order belief of norman’s “contributes to his acceptance of his original belief about the President’s whereabouts in the sense that were norman to become convinced that he did not have this power, he would also cease to accept the belief about the President.” bonJour contends that the higher‐order belief would be “obviously irrational” because it is neither evidentially supported nor (bonJour stipulates) even reli­ ably formed; he then concludes that the charge of irrationality must also be brought against “the belief about the President which ex hypothesi depends on it.” The character of this dependence is somewhat unclear. bonJour is not claiming that the original belief about the President was generated by some reasoning that included reliance on the problematic higher‐order belief: indeed, in an endnote bonJour stresses that the original belief is non‐inferential, and that the higher‐order belief “is not in any useful sense norman’s reason for accepting that specific belief ” (1980: 72). It is not entirely clear how to reconcile this last remark with the claim that the higher‐order belief “contributes to” norman’s acceptance of the belief about the President, in the sense that its absence would spell the end of that acceptance. Perhaps norman’s irrational belief about his powers somehow impedes him from giving his belief about the President’s whereabouts serious rational scrutiny; rather than positively supporting his lower‐level belief, the higher‐order belief may simply stop him from entering a more self‐critical frame of mind in which the lower‐level belief would come to seem problematic to him. kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 249 In  any event, the main thrust of the argument here is then that the lower‐level belief should be seen as unjustified because its continued maintenance depends on the posses­ sion of an unjustified belief. However, norman’s initial formation of his belief about the President is not itself directly criticized. bonJour then considers a more radical version of the scenario, in which norman does not even believe that he has clairvoyance. Again bonJour imagines the possibility of norman engaging in some self‐conscious moment of reflection: but if this specification is added to the case, it now becomes more than a little puzzling to understand what norman thinks is going on. From his standpoint, there is apparently no way in which he could know the President’s whereabouts. Why then does he continue to maintain the belief that the President is in new york City? Why is not the mere fact that there is no way, as far as he knows or believes, for him to have obtained this information a sufficient reason for classifying this belief as an unfounded hunch and ceasing to accept it? And if norman does not do this, is he not thereby being epistemically irrational and irresponsible? (1980: 62–3) In answering his own rhetorical question, bonJour says that “norman’s acceptance of the belief about the President’s whereabouts is epistemically irrational and irresponsible, and thereby unjustified” (1980: 63). When we attend to what norman would do under reflec­ tion, bonJour stresses that there would be a problem if norman were to “continue to maintain” his original belief: it is emphasized that it would be very bad of him to do such a thing. What is striking in these passages is that the hypothetical phase of reflection is still not quite presented as testing the legitimacy of norman’s original belief. The original belief is never made the focus of criticism: bonJour invites us to imagine norman reflect­ ing, and elicits the intuition that norman would be going wrong if he continued to main­ tain the belief on reflection, but he does not overtly draw the conclusion that this shows norman’s original belief about the location of the President to have already been epistemically unjustified at the time of its formation. So norman is never described as “irresponsible” for having formed his belief about the President in the first place, for example, although it is stressed that it would be irresponsible of him to maintain it under reflection. We can intuitively sense that the belief about the President would seem unwar­ ranted from the standpoint of a reflective norman  –  indeed from that perspective he might come to classify it (incorrectly) as an “unfounded hunch” – but we are never explic­ itly directed to go back and reconsider norman’s original unselfconscious state of mind and find fault with it. The intuitive cases do not give us reasons to accept the internalists’ subjunctive conditional about justification; rather, they presuppose its truth. There is a natural explanation why norman, Amanda and Mr. Truetemp cannot be faulted for the original formation of their preternaturally accurate beliefs: these beliefs are not the product of controlled cognition, and the charge of irresponsibility can only stick where there is some possible degree of control. When we are thinking systematically, directing attention to the contents of working memory, we can be distracted or fail to control our attention appropriately; one can be irresponsible in generalizing hastily from a few data points, for example, or in doing a complex arithmetical calculation carelessly, with somewhat divided attention. but the kind of thinking that produces answers 250 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y automatically cannot itself be irresponsible; because it does not depend on cognitive effort we do not have the same sense that supplying additional effort would have made it better. If the notion of epistemic justification is tied to the regulation of epistemic effort, then it has no clear application to involuntary cognition as such: it is not as though by trying harder norman, Amanda or Mr. Truetemp could cease to form their paranormal beliefs. There is nothing epistemically objectionable about having a hunch, even when there would be something epistemically objectionable about endorsing it on reflection. The internalist cases are supposed to make the point that beliefs cannot be justified in the absence of consciously accessible reasons; however, they invite us to focus on the epis­ temic state of subjects who are thinking reflectively, and indeed actively searching for reasons in support of what they believe. It is easy for us to do this because the judgments being made by these subjects involve exactly the sorts of unexpected propositions that would naturally make us stop and double‐check ourselves. In this self‐critical frame of mind, the absence of consciously available reasons would indeed be a problem; what has not been shown is that consciously available reasons are always required whether or not one is presently engaged in self‐criticism. It has furthermore not been shown that the self‐critical frame of mind is itself required for the production of justified beliefs. bonJour does offer the following thoughts about the self‐critical frame of mind: “Part of one’s epistemic duty is to reflect critically upon one’s beliefs, and such critical reflec­ tion precludes believing things to which one has, to one’s knowledge, no reliable means of epistemic access” (bonjour 1980: 63). reasonably enough, bonJour does not here attempt to argue that critical reflection must be one’s constant mode of thought: it is perfectly compatible with its being one of our duties that we only reflect critically on our beliefs from time to time. but even intermittent reflection is a state of mind about which the reliabilist might have mixed feelings. The thought that reflection will preclude our believ­ ing things to which we have no known reliable means of access might be a selling point for reflection, if one were antecedently committed to the view that knowledge of one’s means of epistemic access is a requirement for epistemic justification. but those who are not yet sold on internalism might be less pleased by the thought that reflection can stop one from forming beliefs by means of processes of (as yet) unknown accuracy. For a reliabilist, the benefits of being barred in this manner from having certain unreliably formed beliefs would have to be weighed against the costs of being barred from having reliably formed beliefs as long as the reliability of their formation remained unknown. The self‐critical frame of mind brings dangers as well as rewards, and the reliabilist can hold that there are some circumstances in which it would be good to avoid it. Going back to the first version of the norman scenario, in which his unjustified higher‐order belief stops norman from being self‐critical, the reliabilist could part company with the internalist and characterize this failure to reflect as a happy accident. From the reliabilist perspective, norman’s poorly‐founded thought about his powers fortunately enough enabled him to make use of his paranormal faculty to gain accurate beliefs about the President’s whereabouts. bonJour’s cases do succeed in eliciting intuitions that a self‐critical frame of mind would result in norman’s abandoning his belief; bonJour has not however given an independent argument to support the claim that a self‐critical frame of mind always yields a better epistemic outcome. kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 251 This section has argued that there is something strangely off‐target in bonJour’s attempts to use a hypothetical process of acceptance as a diagnostic of the justification of unreflectively formed beliefs. our conclusions about what norman should do if he were being self‐conscious are never directly related to the propriety of his unselfconscious beliefs. The interesting question is why it is not immediately evident to us that our imagi­ native exercises with the internalist scenarios end up answering a question somewhat different from the question to which we were originally promised an answer. one possible reason is that reading the elaborated cases puts us in a state of mind in which it is naturally difficult to appreciate or even register the state of mind we originally wanted to investi­ gate. In general, we have difficulty representing the state of mind of more naive agents; the fundamental bias of mental state ascription is a bias towards egocentrism, in which privileged concerns tend to be projected onto others, without our realizing it (for reviews, see birch and bloom 2004; royzman et  al. 2003; Apperly 2011). once we are worried about how a reflective norman would search his mind in vain for higher‐order support for his belief about the President, it will be hard for us to evaluate norman’s actual unre­ flective belief formation accurately, even if we try. We would have a natural tendency to evaluate norman as though he were also engaged in self‐scrutiny, despite our awareness of the explicit stipulation that he is not (for more detailed argument on this point, see nagel 2010, 2012b). If these cases still elicit the intuitive sense that norman has gone wrong from the start, these intuitions need to be handled with caution: given that they are triggered by manipulations that generally lead to inaccurate mental state representations, their evidential value is dubious. As long as they trigger a self‐conscious frame of mind in the reader, internalists can exploit a vulnerability of our natural capacity to evaluate the mental states of others: they can make it seem that all belief formation should pass the tests appropriate to self‐conscious belief formation. Whether or not those tests really are decisive is a question that is not well answered by the intuitions produced in this manner. 5 Reliabilism Versus another Rival So far the argument has been strictly defensive: the aim has been to establish that certain celebrated internalist cases provide no clear reason to reject reliabilism. This defense par­ tially accommodates the internalist point that there is a special place for the subject’s point of view in the generation of knowledge: as long as subjects are thinking in a manner whose reliability depends on the availability of appropriate material in consciousness – and much of our thought does work this way  –  then their beliefs should be supportable by con­ sciously accessible reasons. The elegance of the reliabilist position is that it can explain the value of consciously accessible reasons in terms of their contribution to reliability, in the broader context of an epistemological theory that insists uniformly on the value of reliability in all belief formation. looking at the broader context, one useful contribution of reliabilist epistemology has been in the range of cases it has offered up for intuitive assessment. breaking away from a tradition of self‐conscious evaluation of difficult cases, Goldman has drawn to our attention cases in which we would not ordinarily be self‐conscious – say, remembering a well‐known 252 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y trivia fact such as lincoln’s birthdate (in Goldman 1967); he has also paid special attention to our third‐person assessments of others making routine perceptual judgments (Goldman 1976). If there is a risk of misrepresenting others’ thinking when we enter an especially self‐conscious frame of mind, then by focusing on these mundane cases of unselfconscious thought we can give intuition a firmer footing across a wider range of circumstances. our natural tendency to evaluate these cases positively does seem to put pressure on views according to which positive evaluation should always demand some more elaborate or delib­ erate kind of reasoning. one reason why it is important for the reliabilist to account for the internalist cases is that reliabilism itself leans on intuition: the theory gains much of its plausibility from its agreement with intuitive responses to a wide range of particular cases. Someone impressed by the fit between reliabilism and epistemic intuition might still wonder exactly how much support intuition can provide for reliabilism. even if reliabi­ lism can be fully defended against the cases advanced by lehrer and bonJour, there could be other, more effective, intuitive counterexamples waiting in the wings. A further worry concerns the inherent limitations of the intuitive method: perhaps the absence of solid intuitive counterexamples to reliabilism could be explained by something other than the truth of reliabilism. It is this latter worry that I want to explore, briefly, in this concluding section. The original aim of reliabilism was to “specify in non‐epistemic terms when a belief is justified,” or more broadly, when a belief has positive epistemic status (Goldman 1979: 90). In contrast to theories which analyze knowledge in terms of “good reasons” or “the right to be sure,” reliabilism looks to furnish “an account of knowing that focuses on more primitive and pervasive aspects of cognitive life” (Goldman 1976: 791). The starting point for reliabilism  –  the primitive “non‐epistemic term” on which the theory is built  –  is belief, and the natural condition which distinguishes the beliefs which are justified or amount to knowledge is their having been formed by a process that tends to yield true beliefs. As is well‐known, we face a difficult problem in explaining how the relevant processes are individuated. If an account of knowledge is to be constructed from strictly non‐epistemic materials, it needs to be able to identify the process responsible for a given belief without already using our understanding of the nature of knowledge to do so. v There is a live question about whether our intuitive individuation of the processes respon­ sible for belief formation is actually “non‐epistemic.” It would be good news for reliabi­ lism if it were: reliabilism would be capturing something very significant about the generation of our epistemic intuitions if we did in fact naturally ascribe knowledge by recognizing an agent as having some belief and then evaluating the process that gave rise to it as a reliable one, on the basis of purely non‐epistemic features of that process and the agent’s environment. but this is not the only way our intuitions might work, and one possible limitation on the support they could provide to reliabilism can be explored by looking at another model of intuitive assessment. This rival model is associated with a program in epistemology which has an interesting resemblance to reliabilism: Williamson’s “knowledge‐first” program. The core condition of reliabilism is a modal one: knowledge requires thinking in a way that tends to yield true belief. The core commitment of Williamson’s view also has a truth‐centered modal element: knowledge is distinguished as the most general factive state of mind, where kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 253 factive states of mind are “states whose essence includes a matching between mind and world” (Williamson 2000: 40). Again, knowing is not simply happening to hit the truth; the person who knows is in an essentially (as opposed to just accidentally) correct state of mind. one key difference between these rival views concerns the relationship between knowledge and belief: for the reliabilist, the state of belief is our starting point in episte­ mology, and knowledge is seen as a special type of belief – the type that not only is but also tends to be right. For Williamson, knowledge is the starting point in epistemology: the person who believes is doing something which in some sense approximates or aspires to the condition of knowing, and might fall short of that condition in any number of ways. knowledge does also entail belief in his view, but the knower is not simply a believer who meets some set of further conditions themselves specifiable in non‐epistemic terms. For an advocate of the knowledge‐first view, it is not surprising that we have difficulties producing robust intuitive counterexamples to reliabilism. If we try to build a theory of knowledge by starting with belief, we are starting with a state of mind that is not essen­ tially factive: after all, we can believe propositions that are not true, or whose truth is not essential to our believing them. From this field of states that are roughly knowledge‐like but might or might not tend to be right, reliabilism selects as worthy of positive epistemic evaluation just the ones that tend to be right. From a knowledge‐first perspective, sorting beliefs by their tendency to be right would be the best possible step in the direction of recapturing the distinctive character of knowledge (its essential correctness). What the advocate of the knowledge‐first view will expect, however, is that the reliabilist will not find a natural or illuminating non‐epistemic way to individuate the processes that tend to be right. on this view, our individuation of the relevant processes is made possible by our understanding of knowledge, and not vice versa. If we naturally come up with ways of individuating belief‐forming process types that save reliabilism from counterexamples, this is because our intuitive identification of ways of thinking are shaped in the first place by our sense of what it is to know something. When we intuitively recognize someone as knowing something, it is not obvious that we start by recognizing that person as having a belief – a representational state that might or might not be correct – then identify the process responsible for it, and then assess the reliability of this process. our default understanding of others might presume that they have states of mind that essentially reflect various features of our shared environment, and there may be a restricted range of circumstances in which we naturally see others as having states of mind that are potentially out of line with reality. Whether our starting point is knowledge or belief seems to me to be an extremely difficult question in the theory of mental state ascription, and not something to be tackled here (for some discus­ sion, see nagel 2012a). For present purposes, it will be enough to focus on one factor that could be clouding our view of this question, not least because this factor was an active ingredient in the internalist cases discussed above. The cautionary lesson of the internalist cases was that the self‐conscious first‐person perspective can distort our understanding of an agent’s state of mind. one risk of the self‐conscious frame of mind is that it can make self‐conscious thinking seem like the only good path, and one of the attractions of reliabilism as a program in epistemology was its invitation to step back to the unselfconscious third‐person perspective. but another 254 kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y possible risk of the self‐conscious perspective is that it may make it seem to us that our starting point in epistemology must always be belief, rather than knowledge. From the inside, when we reflect on our commitment to any particular proposition, we can typically raise the question of whether it might be wrong, and come to see our mental state as potentially out of line with reality. The problem may be worsened by a natural tendency to see ourselves as having privileged, transparent access to our own mental states. vi but if it appears to us in some circumstances that no state of mind could be essentially right, and that all our mental states at their most essential level must have the potential to be wrong, this appearance might be an understandable product of the circumstances, rather than a clear guide to how things are. Goldman observed in the introduction to his 2006 book Simulating Minds that there has been little contact between epistemology and the theory of mental state ascription, and reported that he had no immediate plans to bring these research projects together (Goldman 2006: 10). In his more recent work, most notably his romanell lecture of 2010, Goldman has taken up the project of showing how empirical work on mental state attribution can be useful to epistemology. In particular, he has argued that to the extent that epistemologists derive evidential support for their theories from intuitions about mental states, they can benefit from learning about natural limitations on our intuitive capacities to recognize mental states (Goldman 2010). but it is also possible that work in epistemology can be useful to our understanding of mindreading. Perhaps the strategy that enabled Goldman to advance reliabilism in epistemology could be applied to a core problem in mindreading, the problem of the relationship between belief and knowledge attribution. It is presently an open question whether such efforts could succeed; it is also an open question whether such an application of the externalist strategy could ultimately lead us to reject reliabilism in favor of a more radical alternative.vii Notes i Goldman has elsewhere suggested that internalist cases involving hypothetical psychics might trigger a negative response in virtue of their association with “scientifically disreputable” faculties (1992, 1994). This suggestion is not unreasonable, but because it does not generalize very smoothly to the superficially similar case of Mr. Truetemp, one wonders whether a better explanation of our negative response to these cases could be found. ii This way of understanding the cases has something in common with John Greco’s approach, according to which, “Truetemp accepts the truth because the tempucomp is reliable, not because he is reliable” (2003: 40). It may well feel natural for us to identify the agent himself with his explicit or personal‐level reasoning. I am not convinced that the specific commitments of agent reliabilism are required to make sense of our overall pattern of intuitions, however. iii As a matter of empirical fact, it seems that consciously available evidence of the accuracy of a belief‐forming mechanism actually does have to accumulate before we can reflectively accept its deliverances (on this point see beebe 2004). Indeed, there is evidence that our ordinary capac­ ity for self‐monitoring is the product of learned associations between various consciously acces­ sible characteristics of our own cognitive processing and reinforcement of the deliverances of that processing (e.g., Unkelbach 2007). For further discussion of the relationship between metacognition and endorsement, see (Michaelian 2012). kno W led G e A nd rel IA b I l IT y 255 iv There are of course various other ways of combining reliabilism with respect for evidence. For example, Juan Comesaña has advocated a form of “evidentialist reliabilism” in which justified beliefs must always be based on evidence, where the appropriate type of reasoning from evi­ dence to belief is reliable (Comesaña 2010). Comesaña supports the demand for evidence by appeal to the intuitive pull of the internalist cases, rather than seeing evidence as something whose value is secured exactly by its contribution to reliability. However, if we can account for the internalist cases without positing a need for evidential input across the board, then it would be more economical for the reliabilist just to allow that evidence is needed in some conditions for the sake of its contribution to reliability. v For a particularly clear statement of this challenge to reliabilism, see (brewer 1999: ch.4). vi For a detailed argument that we do not have such access, but do have the illusion of having it, see (Carruthers 2011). vii Thanks to Sergio Tenenbaum, Tim Williamson, and Selim berker for comments and discussion, and thanks to the Social Sciences and Humanities research Council of Canada for funding my research.

Jennifer nagel offers a highly unusual and intriguing perspective on a prominent class of counterexamples to reliabilism. In effect, she challenges the “data” presented in those examples. That is, she challenges the intuitive judgments that their proponents advance, thereby finding a way for reliabilism to “escape” from this line of attack. nagel’s line of defense of reliabilism (in this specific territory) is strikingly different from ones that reli­ abilists themselves have advanced. It is a previously unexplored option. Its presentation and rationale offer a great deal of novel insight into the relevant epistemic terrain. Finally, nagel’s exploration of the territory is guided by interesting applications of dual‐systems theory, an influential movement in current cognitive science. All in all, we have a highly original and thought‐provoking brew. There are several stages in the tale nagel tells. The first step is to argue that the counter examples offered by bonJour and lehrer have an important complexity that is often overlooked, and when one studies them carefully, the subjects described are seen not to be using reliable methods (as advertised) but rather unreliable methods (or processes). Although bonJour and lehrer verbally stipulate that the subjects form their respective beliefs reliably, the details of how each subject proceeds negate that verbal stipulation. Instead it is appropriate to classify their beliefs as unjustified, just as these internalists claim. but this is not a problem for reliabilism, because, nagel argues, the subjects violate the reliability requirements on justifiedness (despite what bonJour and lehrer “declare”). Here’s what nagel says about lehrer’s Mr. Truetemp: Paying close attention to lehrer’s description of the case, we see that the belief‐forming process is not complete when the original temperature thoughts are generated: lehrer characterizes the device as “causing [Truetemp] to think of the temperature recorded by the Reply to nagel 258 re P l y T o n A G el external sensor,” but thinking of something is not the same as believing that something is so. … [I]t is not until he mentions Mr. Truetemp’s unreflective acceptance of the thoughts about the temperature that lehrer actually characterizes Mr. Truetemp as endorsing those thoughts.… Here the reliabilist might wonder whether our negative intuitions about the case are being generated by the pivotal second stage of Mr. Truetemp’s judgment  –  his “unreflective acceptance” of the puzzling intrusive thoughts. nagel thus argues that unreflective acceptance is naturally understood as an unreliable method of belief formation. In other words, yes, we are intuitively driven to classify Mr. Truetemp’s belief as unjustified. but this isn’t a count against reliabilism unless the case is one in which a fully reliable process is used. And although there is “talk” of a reliable process, this talk is undercut by the detailed description of the case. So there is no genuine counterexample here against reliabilism. A crucial line in nagel’s argument concerns the role of what is available to first‐person awareness. She argues that when one is engaged in System‐2 (S2) thinking, then what is available to consciousness, or working memory, is crucial. It’s not that all species of reliable belief‐formation (or belief‐retention) require accessibility to consciousness. Specifically, this is not required for System‐1 (S1) thinking, which is often reliable despite being highly automatic. but access to consciousness is often required for S2 processes to be reliable. In those cases where it is required – but not available – the processes in question will tend to be unreliable. And that’s exactly the sorts of cases that lehrer and bonJour describe. The reliabilist can admit that in those cases, where accessibility to consciousness is critical but lacking, subjects’ beliefs will be unreliably formed and hence unjustified. but this doesn’t require any concession to a global requirement on conscious accessibility of the sort that internalists (especially somebody like bonJour) emphasize. This is a very neat package, if I have understood it properly, and certainly an original one. Whether it can carry the day for reliabilism in this territory remains to be seen, however. The main alert I would sound is this. nagel’s line of argument may work well in application to the bonJour and lehrer cases specifically; but will it work if applied to permutations of these cases, especially permutations involving purely S1 cases, where no accessibility to consciousness figures in the story at all? I don’t know the answer to this question, but it is well worthy of investigation. Goldman and His Critics, First Edition. Edited by Brian P. McLaughlin and Hilary Kornblith. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Goldman on Knowledge of Mind Christ o p her s . h ill 12 It is quite striking how many of Goldman’s contributions have initiated or transformed discussions, sending the philosophical literature in new directions. The range of his writ- ing is also striking: among other things, he has written about action, perception, social power, epistemic justification, introspection, commonsense metaphysics, the social dimension of knowledge, mental state ascription, and the relationship between knowledge and embodiment. What I find most striking, however, is that it is always a joy to read Goldman’s books and papers for the first time. As I follow his line of thought, I often find myself thinking, “Yes! This is so clearly right!” I love having those aperçus, and in reading Goldman, I have as many of them per page as my mind can handle. Of course, since it is philosophy I am reading, those initial perceptions may well be revised at a later date; but even when this happens, I almost always continue to hold Goldman’s ideas in high esteem, seeing them as things that ought to have been entertained and that must be kept in mind as reference points in future deliberations. I will focus here on three parts of Goldman’s work, beginning with his model of the processes that underlie ascriptions of mental states to others. I will maintain that Goldman errs in ignoring the role that knowledge of testimony plays in those processes. As I see it, testimony is one of our main sources of evidence concerning other minds; but it has received little or no attention in the recent literature about “mindreading,” either from Goldman or from theorists with quite different views. I hope to correct this imbalance. My second topic will be the theory of introspection that Goldman developed in the early 1990s. The reader may be surprised to find that most of my remarks are concerned with this topic, given that Goldman’s views about introspection have changed dramati- cally in recent years. It is my impression, however, that that his earlier theory has been hugely influential, and that it continues to shape research on cognitive phenomenology 260 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd and self‐knowledge. It is alive and well in the literature, even if not in Goldman’s heart and mind. In discussing this theory, I will develop and defend an account of cognitive phenomenology that is sharply at variance with the account of phenomenology that the theory presupposes, and will maintain that my alternative account undercuts the theory’s central claims about introspection. My third topic will be Goldman’s more recent theory of introspection – the theory that he develops in Simulating Minds. In discussing this topic, I will sketch alternatives to the main components of Goldman’s theory, together with some of the motivation for accepting them. I will not, however, maintain that these alternative hypotheses are clearly preferable to Goldman’s proposals. So far, there is too little evidence for any such claim to be appropriate. 1 The Role of Testimony in Mental State Ascription There are three main schools of thought about the sources of our knowledge of other minds. Advocates of the theory‐theory maintain that mindreading generally involves inter- preting the behavior of others in terms of a commonsense folk theory. Simulationists argue that we rely principally on the practice of simulating the mental processes of those whom we’re trying to understand. According to them, when we are concerned to arrive at a new hypothesis about the mind of another agent, we begin by pretending that we ourselves are in mental states that the agent is already known to possess, and we then apply our own mental faculties to these make‐believe states. After processing these inputs, the faculties produce a new mental state. This new state is also make‐believe, but on the assumption that our faculties are similar to those of the agent we are trying to simulate, it is very likely to resemble a state that the agent actually possesses. The last stage of this process is pro- jection: we attribute the state to the agent. The third school of thought consists of sup- porters of hybrid theories. According to them, we sometimes use a commonsense psychological theory in forming hypotheses about the mental states of others, and at other times we rely on simulation. There is a range of hybrid theories, with degrees of separa- tion being determined by the size of the roles that are assigned respectively to the two methods. Goldman is a hybrid theorist. On his version of the view, simulation is the method of choice in a preponderance of cases. It is a surprising feature of the literature on mindreading that very little attention is given to the testimony of the people whose minds one is trying to fathom. There are occa- sional references to testimony, but there is no systematic treatment of its role, nor even any acknowledgement that it provides a primary source of evidence. It is neglected by all three of the schools of thought that I have just distinguished. This is especially striking when one notices that reliance on testimony minimizes the need to interpret behavior in terms of commonsense psychology, and also makes simulation unnecessary in most cases. If you can ask another agent what she is thinking or feeling, there is no need to engage in com- plex theoretical reasoning that is based on auxiliary assumptions about mental states and laws of commonsense psychology. nor is there any need to apply the attributor’s faculties to pretend states. Or so it seems. GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 261 There are as yet no statistics concerning the degree to which we rely on testimony in our attributive practice, but I think we can appreciate that it plays a very large role by considering vignettes like these: A) You and your friend Tim have agreed to go to a movie tonight, but have yet to choose among several promising options. You want to know if Tim has a preference. How will you find out? B) You and Carol are paddling kayaks along a shoreline. She pauses in midstroke and begins to stare intently in the direction of a shed in a field to her right. What is she looking at, you wonder? Is it the shed itself, or the man who is walking towards it, or the dog who is sleeping in front? Or has she perhaps seen a bird that escaped your attention? How will you find out? C) There has been much discussion in the newspapers lately about a political crisis in Ukraine. Russian troops are gathered along the border, apparently with a view to intervening. You want to know what Pamela thinks about the prospects of an inva- sion. How will you find out? d) You and Miquel have been talking animatedly, but now he has fallen silent. Have you annoyed him in some way? Or bored him with your chatter? Or is he just tired and in need of an interlude? What is Miquel feeling? How will you find out? Of course, if you are on intimate terms with these people, you might be able to use knowledge of their character, interests, and enduring beliefs as a basis for framing plausi- ble answers to your questions about their mental states. If so, you won’t need to ask them to express their mental states in words. But it seems that eliciting testimony is the default approach – the one that you would in fact take in most cases. Moreover, assuming that you are in fact on intimate terms with one or more of the people in the vignettes, we must ask how you acquired your deep knowledge of the relevant enduring traits. It seems likely that your knowledge is based on past testimony to a large degree. I have been arguing that testimony is a very important source of evidence concerning the mental states of others. I will now urge that it is a more or less fundamental source, in the sense that inferences from testimony to underlying mental states have a kind of auton- omy. Such inferences presuppose what might be called psycholinguistic heuristics, but they require no assumptions about particular mental states. This is important. If we had to make additional assumptions about mental states in order to move from observations of testimony to conclusions about beliefs and other attitudes, there would be a question about the source of these additional assumptions. And it might be thought that we arrive at them by simulation, or by making use of portions of commonsense psychology that are not concerned with language. If one of these ideas was correct, the use of testimony would depend on processes of one or both of these other kinds, and would be less deserving of separate attention in discussions of mindreading. One way to bring this issue to the fore is to recall the disquotation principle that kripke promulgates in developing a puzzle about belief (kripke 2011: 137). Here it is: If a normal english speaker, on reflection, sincerely assents to “p,” then he believes that p. 262 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd now clearly, if it was true that we rely on this principle in moving from observations of testimony to conclusions about belief, it would also be true that we are obliged to make assumptions about the speaker’s other mental states along the way. We would need to assume that he is speaking sincerely, and also that he is speaking reflectively. These would be psychological assumptions. Because of this, if one thinks that we rely on something like the disquotation principle in our psycholinguistic reasoning, one might also think that we must rely on simulation or a commonsense theory too, in order to secure the additional assumptions about the speaker’s mental states. It is possible that something like this kripkean picture is correct. As I see it, however, we get a simpler and therefore more plausible picture of reasoning based on testimony if we suppose that the relevant inferences are guided by psycholinguistic heuristics like the following: If a normal english speaker utters a declarative sentence which means that p, then you may assume that the speaker believes that p. If a normal english speaker utters a declarative sentence which means that the speaker is in a conscious mental state, then you may assume that the speaker really is in that state. The alternative picture I have in mind acknowledges that the ascriptions of mental states underwritten by these heuristics are highly defeasible. More specifically, it acknowledges that they can be defeated by information to the effect that speakers are not speaking sin- cerely, by information that speakers have made errors due to haste, multitasking, or inat- tentiveness, and also by information to the effect that their utterances are not intended as assertions. Hence, the picture allows that perceptions concerning a range of mental states are relevant to psycholinguistic reasoning. But it doesn’t imply that we must make assumptions about such states in order to get started on mindreading. To apply the heuristics, we need to determine that an agent is a normal english speaker. How do we make such determinations? does making them require any psychological assumptions? Arguably, the answer is “no.” for it could be that we rely principally on behavioral data and a linguistic heuristic in arriving at conclusions about linguistic abilities. My thought is that the heuristic might look something like this: If an agent conforms to the patterns of using words and sentences that prevail in a linguistic community, then you may assume that the agent is a member of that community. The rele- vant patterns include the ways sentences are structured, the ways words are used to encode and transmit information, and salient correlations between expressive terms on the one hand, and postures and facial expressions on the other. This heuristic emphasizes the behavioral dimension of language use at the expense of the psychological dimension: it implies that it is possible to identify speakers of a lan- guage without relying on principles linking linguistic behavior to mental states. notice that it has no tendency to contradict the views of philosophers like davidson, who main- tain that meaning and mind are inextricably connected. It is not the point of the heuristic to offer an analysis of what it is to use a language, but simply to make explicit the defea- sible cues that guide us in assigning speakers to linguistic communities in everyday life. It is plausible, I think, that we do in fact rely on the heuristic, or on something in the GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 263 same ballpark. Children need something like it to guide their development, and adults need something like it when meeting members of different linguistic communities for the first time. Children learn large stretches of language before they become adept at folk psychology. Also, we are generally able to recognize new acquaintances as speakers of english, french, or German before we are in a position to formulate hypotheses about their propositional attitudes, emotions, or personalities. In summary, I am inclined to think that testimony plays a large role in our practice of attributing mental states to others, and also that its role is at least superficially autonomous, in the sense we proceed directly from observations of testimony to conclusions about propositional attitudes, without making use of any assumptions about the mental states of speakers, and therefore without relying on simulation or taking any detours through the purely psychological portion of our conceptual scheme.i Is the role of testimony also deeply autonomous? for that to be the case, it would have to be true that we originally acquire the foregoing psycholinguistic heuristics without relying on simulation or purely psychological reasoning. There are two possibilities here. One is that the heuristics are more or less fundamental. The other is that we arrive at them by registering correlations between utterances of sentences and the propositional attitudes of speakers, where the attitudes are identified independently of language – perhaps by simu- lation, or perhaps by applications of principles of folk psychology that are concerned exclusively with mental states and non‐linguistic behavior. It’s clear from the work of developmental psychologists that heuristics for attributing certain mental states come on‐line at a very early age. As far as I can see, however, these early heuristics cannot by themselves explain our practice of attributing mental states that are very finely individuated. Beliefs are examples of such states, because they are individuated in part by their logical forms. (The belief that Sarah won’t be here for dinner is distinct from the belief that if Sarah is here for dinner, then she won’t be here for dinner, despite the fact that the two beliefs are logically equivalent, and therefore have exactly the same truth conditions.) ‘As the example of belief shows,’ we are much concerned with attributing finely individuated states, both in everyday life and in cognitive science. What is important here, however, is not the finely individuated states themselves, but rather the nature of the data that we must rely on in attributing the states. Reflection shows that that the data in question must be linguistic data – that is, facts involving subjects’ assertions of sentences and responses to sentences. Only linguistic data are finely individuated enough to support the attribution of hyperinten- sional states like beliefs. By the same token, the heuristics that guide us in attributing beliefs must rely heavily on linguistic inputs, and must therefore be quite different from the heuris- tics that come on‐line during the very early, pre‐linguistic stages of development. ii 2 Goldman’s Early Theory of Introspection In 1993 Goldman published two important papers (Goldman 1993a, 1993b) on the nature of mental states and our introspective access to them. One of his principal con- tentions was that conscious mental states, including occurrent propositional attitudes, have distinctive phenomenologies, and the other was that awareness of phenomenology 264 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd plays a crucial role in our classifications of mental states. Here are a couple of repre- sentative passages: It is uncontroversial that naïve subjects attribute mental states to themselves, using ordinary mental terms like “believe,” “want,” plan,” “itch,” and so forth. I shall argue that the best explanation for this cognitive‐linguistic activity is the genuine occurrence of events of phe- nomenal consciousness which are categorized in intrinsic rather than relational terms. (1993b: 119) [I]t looks as if the most promising psychological model of how one’s own mental states are classified is by detecting phenomenal properties of these states, for example, the “itchiness” of an itch or the “headachy” quality of a headache. (1993b: 122) It is natural to see these passages as offering a picture that can be formulated as follows: A) Conscious mental states have intrinsic phenomenologies that distinguish them from each other. B) We are introspectively aware of conscious mental states by virtue of being aware of their respective phenomenologies. This picture is, I believe, endorsed by a number of contemporary writers. Prominent examples include Siewart, Horgan and Tiensen, Pitt, and kriegel. I will be concerned principally with its second component, proposition (B). In considering (B), I will focus on the special case involving awareness of thoughts –  specifically, on the doctrine that we are introspectively aware of thoughts by virtue of being aware of phenomenal episodes. By thoughts I shall understand mental events that have logical forms and truth conditions, at least in the deflationary sense, and that can easily be captured in words. (To be sure, many thoughts lack truth conditions – for example, the thought Diet be damned! But those thoughts are largely composed of ele- ments that can also figure in thoughts that do have truth conditions. Anyway, I am not aiming for a bullet‐proof definition here.) further, in speaking of thinking, I will be exclusively concerned with episodes or series of episodes that consist in entertaining thoughts, in the indicated sense of “thought.” I believe that this is one of the standard uses of “thinking,” but there is of course another one, according to which all forms of reasoning and problem‐solving count as thinking, regardless of the representational medium in which they are couched. In this broader use of the term, Beethoven was thinking when he was entertaining auditory images of pas- sages of music, trying to find a passage that would most suitably continue a work that he was composing, and you are thinking when you visually simulate the next series of moves in a game of chess. I will now sketch a theory of cognitive phenomenology that calls proposition (B) into question. I don’t know of any one author, other than myself, who holds all components of the theory in the form that I will give them here, but I think that each of its components has many contemporary admirers. The theory consists of eight theses. I will wait till the end to describe the motivation for the first thesis, but I will sketch justifications for the others as we proceed. GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 265 1 The phenomenology of thought is exhaustively constituted by auditory imagery and articulatory sensations in the mouth, throat, and tongue. Auditory imagery is always present; articulatory sensations are less frequent but they can be more pronounced. 2 Auditory images and articulatory sensations are distinct from thoughts. Accordingly, the phenomenology that is associated with thought is not intrinsic to thought itself, but is rather an effect of thought. Auditory images and thoughts are distinct because they have different representa- tional contents. Thoughts are concerned with external phenomena of all kinds – the friend who is walking through the woods with you, the trillium growing on the left of the path, what you had for breakfast, the novel you are currently reading, the size of your savings account, the impending visit of your father, and so on. On the other hand, auditory imagery of the relevant sort is concerned exclusively with properties of human speech. It is also implausible that articulatory sensations are identical with thoughts. Thoughts are often accompanied by articulatory sensations, but this is by no means universally true. (In the interests of simplicity, I will hereafter set articulatory sensa- tions aside. This won’t skew the general tenor of my remarks.) 3 Since thoughts are distinct from the conscious episodes to which cognitive phenom- enology is attributable, we cannot be said to be aware of thoughts in being aware of phenomenal episodes. At most it could be true that we are aware of the phenomenolo- gies of conscious episodes and then draw inferences about thoughts from these phenomenologies. (Awareness of thoughts requires different representations than awareness of phenomenal episodes. Transitions from representations of phenomenal episodes to representations of thoughts are a kind of inference.) 4 There are two ways of thinking about the phenomenology that is attributable to auditory imagery. On one view, the phenomenology is constituted by properties that are instantiated by imagery. On the other, it is constituted by properties that imagery represents – that is, by properties of spoken words. These two ways of thinking about auditory phenomenology correspond to two familiar ideas about the nature of visual qualia. Some authors maintain that visual qualia are intrinsic properties of visual experiences. To speak metaphorically, these authors think of visual qualia as “mental paint.” Other authors argue that visual qualia are properties of external phenomena that experience represents. Similarly, we can think of auditory qualia as intrinsic properties of auditory experiences, or as prop- erties that auditory experiences attribute to external acoustic events.iii 5 The phenomenology that is attributable to auditory imagery is not constituted by properties that are instantiated by auditory images. Hence, it must be constituted by properties that are represented by auditory images. This is so because considerations of transparency rule out the “mental paint” view in the realm of auditory imagery, just as they do in the realm of veridical auditory experience. To elaborate: the phenomenology attributable to auditory images is of roughly the same kind as the phenomenology associated with auditory experiences of actual acoustic events. But given that the phenomenologies are roughly the same, and given also that the phenomenology associated with auditory experiences of actual 266 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd events is governed by transparency, in the sense that it clearly consists in properties of external phenomena, the phenomenology of auditory images must be governed by transparency as well. 6 We have found that the phenomenology attributable to auditory imagery consists in the fact that such imagery represents properties of external acoustic events. We must now note that in the case of imagery, as opposed to the case of veridical auditory perception, the properties in question are not actually instantiated. It follows that in entertaining auditory imagery, we are not strictly speaking aware of phenomenology. Indeed, in entertaining an auditory image, we are not aware of anything. We represent properties of acoustic events when we entertain auditory images, but we do not verid- ically represent the properties as instantiated, and this means that we are not aware of the properties. Awareness of properties requires veridical representation of things that instantiate them. (note that we cannot be said to be aware of properties when we are hallucinating.) 7 It is a mistake, then, to say that we are aware of thoughts by virtue of being aware of phenomenology. The conscious episodes to which phenomenology is attributable are representational states, but they are not states of transitive awareness. What about introspective states that are directed on auditory images? Can they be said to provide us with awareness of phenomenology? no. They can be classified as states of transi- tive awareness, but they do not afford awareness of phenomenology. They represent mental states; but as we saw, while mental states may represent phenomenal proper- ties, transparency implies that they don’t instantiate phenomenal properties. Hence, all “observation plus inference” models must be rejected, insofar as they maintain that phenomenologies are the objects of observation. 8 Although we are not aware of thoughts by virtue of being aware of distinctive phenomenologies, it could still be true that the states that create an impression of phenomenology (viz. auditory images) play an important role in the processes that provide our introspective grasp of thoughts. for it could be true that the mechanisms that produce introspective representations of thoughts take auditory images as inputs. I know of no strong reasons to think that this is true; given the available evidence, it seems no less likely that the inputs to the mechanisms in question are not images, but rather thoughts themselves – the representations of the world that cause the images. But the idea that auditory images initiate the introspective processes that provide our metacognitive grasp of thoughts deserves consideration. This idea does not itself imply that there is awareness of cognitive phenomenology. It is clear, I think, that if (1)–(8) are correct, then proposition (B) must be rejected. As I indicated earlier, most of the parts of this picture have received favorable attention in the literature. Thesis (1) is familiar from the writings of Byrne (for example, Byrne 2011), Carruthers (for example, Carruthers 2011), and Jackendoff (for example, Jackendoff 2012), among others, and a range of psychologists and linguists have embraced proposi- tions in the neighborhood of (2), maintaining in one way or another that thought itself is to be distinguished from its phenomenal manifestations. Theses (4)–(7) would, I think, be accepted by most of the philosophers who classify themselves as representationalists. GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 267 I hope I have said enough to show that theses (2)–(8) are plausible. I will now cite several considerations that count in favor of thesis (1), the claim that the phenomenology of thought is constituted by auditory and articulatory imagery. first, thesis (1) is supported by a range of dual‐task experiments in which a linguistic activity like verbal shadowing (immediately echoing verbal material that is presented to the ear) disrupts high‐level cognitive tasks that clearly require thought. In a typical study, newton and de Villers (2007) found that shadowing english sentences interfered with reasoning about false beliefs, but that there was no such interference when the verbal shadowing task was replaced by an equally demanding one requiring subjects to shadow a rhythm by tapping. (See Hermer‐Vazquez et al. 1999 (but cf. Ratliff and newcombe 2008 for important qualifications); Winawer et al. 2007; lupyan 2009; frank et al. 2012.) Second, bilinguals report palpable differences between, say, thinking in Russian and thinking in english, and they are often able to identify types of thinking (for example, mathematical calculations) that are more likely to be conducted in one of their languages than the other. (Guerrrero 2005; dewaele 2011). This suggests that thinking in Russian is associated with a different phenomenology than thinking in english. But if this is right, the two phenomenologies must have something to do with language. Accordingly, it is also natural to suppose that the phenomenologies involve auditory and articulatory imagery. Third, thesis (1) is confirmed by introspective evidence concerning the reader’s own experience. Or so I predict. Please recite a verse in foro interno that you know by heart. If you are like me, your inner recitation will have an extremely rich articulatory dimension, consisting of sensations arising from micro‐movements of your tongue and other parts of your vocal apparatus. But also, your recitation will have many prosodic features – stresses, rhythms, intonation contours, and rhymes. Since, as Alex Byrne would put it, there is no real voice in your head (Byrne 2011), these prosodic features must be attributed to audi- tory imagery. And the fact that the features are intimately connected with the words that are the constituents of the poem shows that the latter must be attributed to auditory imagery as well. Apart from the articulatory dimension, your internal recitation of the poem is auditory through and through. now go back to thinking about other matters, but try to do so attentively, so that any accompanying phenomenology receives a boost from attention. If you are like me, you will find that these thoughts are similar to what occurred when you were reciting the verse. There won’t be an accompanying panoply of articulatory sensations, and prosodic fea- tures like rhythm will not be in evidence, but you will nonetheless be strongly inclined to see the phenomenology as fundamentally similar to the explicitly auditory imagery that occurred when you were reciting the poem. Suppose, for example, that an image of a certain word was part of your experience in reciting the poem. If your later thought can be appropriately expressed by using this same word, then, if you are like me, there will be a phenomenological similarity between the recitation and the later thought – a similarity that is best explained by saying that the later thought involved auditory imagery too. not that all cases are like this. You will no doubt be familiar with many cases in which it is less clear to you that your thoughts have an auditory dimension. But if you are like me, as your confidence that your thoughts have an auditory phenomenology diminishes, your confidence that they have a phenomenology of any kind tapers off as well, and tapers 268 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd off at the same rate. I am thinking particularly here of cases in which thoughts arise spontaneously and flit quickly through your mind, without receiving a boost from atten- tion. In such cases you are aware that thoughts are occurring, or are at least retrospectively aware that they have occurred, and you may be aware of their contents, or at least aware of parts of their contents, but you don’t have a robust impression of determinate phenome- nology. That is to say, if you are like me, in cases in which auditory imagery is not in evidence, your appreciation of phenomenology of any kind is reduced proportionally. In such cases, you may only have a sense that episodes are occurring that are endowed with certain contents. fourth, thesis (1) is supported by the testimony of Russell Hurlburt’s subjects. Hurlburt has assembled a large body of relevant data by using a technique that he calls Descriptive Experience Sampling. (In a deS experiment, the subject carries a pager that produces beeps at random intervals, and takes notes on what is before his or her mind at the moments when the pager sounds (see Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007). Hurlburt’s subjects report that their thoughts are often associated with auditory imagery. They describe them as cases of “inner hearing.” But this isn’t the whole story. Hurlburt’s subjects also say that their thoughts sometimes take the form of inner speech, and they contrast these thoughts with the ones that they clas- sify as examples of inner hearing. They describe inner speech as “going away” from the subject, and as “produced by” and “under the control of ” the subject. By contrast, episodes of inner hearing are described as “coming toward” the subject. further, the subject “experi- ences” or “listens to” such episodes, rather than producing them (Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007: 257). At first sight, this poses a problem for thesis (1). But does it really? I don’t think so, for two reasons. first, in the case of visual imagery, there is a distinction between images that one creates or produces and images that simply occur to one. If there is a corresponding distinction in the auditory realm, that could explain why subjects experience some thoughts as “going away” from them and “under their control,” while others seem to “come toward” them and to be received more or less passively. Thoughts of the first sort could be audi- tory  images that subjects create voluntarily, and thoughts of the second kind could be auditory images that arise independently of one’s will. iv Second, in drawing a distinction between inner speech and inner hearing, subjects could in some cases just be calling attention to the distinction between thoughts that are accompanied by articulatory experiences of vari- ous kinds and thoughts that lack an articulatory dimension. But of course, this distinction is compatible with the view that inner speech is normally accompanied by inner hearing. In addition to episodes of inner hearing and inner speech, Hurlburt’s subjects claim to have episodes of “unsymbolized thinking” – that is, “thoughts that have clear, differenti- ated content but no discernible features that ‘carry’ that content: no images, no words, no other kinds of symbols” (Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007: 266). Again, I see no challenge to thesis (1). Reports of unsymbolized thinking certainly suggest that there are thoughts that are not accompanied by auditory imagery, but they also suggest that the thoughts in question have no associated phenomenology of any kind. The subjects indicate that they are aware of contents, period. Testimony of this sort is perfectly compatible with (1). (1) maintains that the phenomenology of thought is constituted by auditory imagery, not that all thoughts are accompanied by phenomenology. GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 269 Before leaving this topic, I should note that there are two ways of understanding testimony concerning unsymbolized thoughts. The simplest way to understand it is to take it at face value, construing it as evidence that there are thoughts without accompa- nying phenomenology. As an alternative, however, we might suppose that “unsymbolized” thoughts are actually accompanied by auditory imagery, but that this phenomenology is immediately lost to view because it receives no boost from attention. It is “faint” and is therefore largely forgotten as soon as it occurs. In a particular case, one or two fragments of the faint imagery may survive in working memory, and, together with information about the context, they may serve as the inputs to an interpretive process that recon- structs the content of the original thought. But one will have no episodic memory of having had the thought, and the fragments that survive in working memory will not by themselves convey a sense of the thought’s full identity. As far as I can determine, this alternative hypothesis about “unsymbolized” thought fits the relevant testimony quite well. And of course, it is fully consistent with thesis (1). As we just observed, the thesis claims only that cognitive phenomenology is constituted by auditory imagery. It takes no stand on the question of how many of our thoughts are accompanied by phenomenology. A fifth reason for accepting thesis (1) is that in attributing the phenomenology of thought to auditory imagery, it implies that the phenomenology of thought is fundamen- tally akin to the phenomenology of a perceptual system  –  specifically, hearing. I have argued elsewhere that all other forms of phenomenology are associated with systems that are essentially perceptual in character, and that this doctrine provides a deep understand- ing both of phenomenology itself and of what is involved in being aware of phenomenol- ogy (Hill 2009, 2014). I have also maintained that alternative ways of viewing these phenomena are poorly motivated and generally lead to insoluble problems. Similar considerations apply here. We can explain the phenomenology of thought if we see it as deriving from auditory phenomenology, but otherwise, our prospects of understanding it are dim. We will simply have to add it to our ontology as an unexplained primitive. Of course, we should not shrink from recognizing unexplained phenomena as real if their reality is sufficiently apparent. But it seems the introspective grounds for supposing that there is non‐auditory phenomenology are quite modest, at best. I turn finally to the relevant neuropsychological evidence, which is provided by studies of the “efference traces” initiated by inner speech. When an agent has formulated a sen- tence and is about to produce it overtly, the speech center sends a signal (or “trace”) to the auditory system that enables it to predict the phonological shape of the sounds that are about to occur. Because of this prediction, the subject is better able to discriminate between speech that is self‐produced and speech coming from others, and is therefore in a better position to bestow attention on what is novel and more informative. It appears that these efference traces from speech centers are produced no less routinely when speech is internal and silent than when it is overt. Moreover, studies comparing the corti- cal destinations of efference traces to the independently identified locations of auditory imagery show that there is a substantial overlap. This is not to say that neuropsychology currently predicts that thoughts are generally be accompanied by auditory imagery. for one thing, the relationship between thought and inner speech is unclear. It could be that 270 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd the efference traces that result from inner speech are too weak to give rise to conscious processes. But what we know today appears to be consistent with thesis (1), and even points to a mechanism that might well be capable of producing the phenomenology with which (1) is concerned. (for discussion see Tian and Poeppel 2012, 2013; Scott 2013; Wang et  al. 2014. for a general review of experimental findings relevant to auditory imagery, see Hubbard 2010.) To summarize: as we have been appreciating, the picture consisting of (1)–(8) is well motivated – the considerations that count in favor of it are reasonably strong. But if the picture is correct, then proposition (B) must be rejected. It is not true that we are aware of thoughts by virtue of being aware of attendant phenomenologies. According to the picture, the episodes to which phenomenology is attributable are auditory images. But auditory images are not states of transitive awareness. Thus, insofar as the phenomenol- ogy of thought is auditory, it is not real, and is therefore not an object of awareness. A related result is that it is a mistake to think that thoughts themselves have distinctive qualitative properties. The episodes to which phenomenology is attributable are merely the effects of thoughts. folk psychology would have us believe otherwise: it fosters the view that thoughts are events in phenomenal consciousness. But insofar as the phenom- enology of thought is attributable to auditory images, this could not possibly be right. The representational contents of auditory images are entirely different than the contents of thoughts. What then is the relationship between thoughts and phenomenal episodes in the stream of consciousness? We should think of it as like the relationship between physi- cal objects (people, trees, buildings, etc.) and the shadows they project. The relationship is contingent and causal, not internal and constitutive. (The idea that thoughts are the off‐stage causes of auditory images seems to be widely held in linguistics. See, for exam- ple, Jackendoff 2012.) I conclude by emphasizing the point of thesis (8). We are not transitively aware of the phenomenology of thought; but even so, it could be true that phenomenology plays an indirect role in producing introspective representations of thoughts, for it could be that the auditory images that represent phenomenal properties are inputs to the processes that produce such representations. I will return to this possibility in the next section. 3 Goldman’s Later Theory of Introspection Simulating Minds appeared in 2006. It presents an account of introspection that is a radi- cal departure from the theory that Goldman favored in the early 1990s. This new theory was changed a bit in Goldman’s contribution to a book symposium on Simulating Minds that appeared a few years later (Goldman 2009), but its main outline was preserved. As far as I know, Goldman continues to hold it today. It is meant to apply to the whole range of mental states, but I will be concerned here exclusively with its treatment of occurrent propositional attitudes. In discussing attitudes, Goldman begins with the familiar distinction between the representational component of the attitude, which determines its content, and its attitude type, which determines whether it is a belief, or a desire, or an attitude of some other kind. GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 271 Thus, for example, he would point out that my belief that it is Halloween has a represen- tational component, a component that represents the state of affairs it is Halloween, and that it also has a nonrepresentational component, in virtue of which it counts as a belief. This distinction plays a large role in shaping his theory of introspection, for it leads him to suppose that introspective awareness of attitudes involves processes of two quite differ- ent types. According to his theory, the processes by which we become aware of represen- tational contents are largely independent of the processes by which we become aware of attitude types. Turning to specifics, the theory claims that we become aware of a representational content by a process that Goldman calls redeployment. This process can be described as follows. Suppose x forms an occurrent belief that has a proposition p as its representa- tional component. p will have a certain logical organization and also a certain content – that is, it will represent a certain state of affairs. now of course, to represent the belief, x must form a representation of p. This representation must capture both the logical structure of p and its content. One way to do this is to form a name of p that literally contains p. That is, it can be done by using an operator that combines with any proposition y to produce a name of y. Clearly, we have an operator that has this property – the operator the proposition that. If we want to produce a name for proposition that it is Halloween, what we do is combine this operator with the proposition it is Halloween. This gives us the name the proposition that it is Halloween. In forming the name of the thought in this way, one is redeploying the proposition. (Usually we abbreviate the operator by suppressing the first two components, leaving just the third component, that.) How then does one become aware of attitude types? Goldman thinks that the process is perception‐like. What this means, among other things, is that attitude types are recog- nized on the basis of features. Suppose you form the belief that it’s Halloween. This state will involve a range of dispositional properties, but it must also have intrinsic, non‐modal features that support these dispositions. It is these features that are ultimately responsible for the fact that your state is a belief rather than an attitude of some other kind. now on Goldman’s account, the features are the inputs to an introspective process that eventually causes you to apply the concept of a belief to the state. The process is essentially one of matching: The concept is associated with representations of the features in question, and when these representations match the features of a state, the concept is triggered. Goldman provides some details about the nature of the matching process, but we can prescind from them here. This is not yet the whole picture. Goldman advocates a dual‐process theory of intro- spection. One of the processes proceeds in the way I have just described – by redeploying representational components, using feature‐recognition procedures to recognize attitude types, and then binding the results together to form coherent wholes. The other process employs folk psychology. It begins by registering information of various kinds, including information about what is transpiring in consciousness, but also information about the subject’s current behavior, and information from a record of the subject’s continuing traits and interests. It then uses the principles of folk psychology to interpret these data. The ultimate result is the self‐attribution of a mental state. Goldman thinks that we are forced to recognize that introspection can involve theory‐based interpretation of this sort 272 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd by experimental data which indicate that we often arrive at self‐attributions by confabulation: as a large range of experiments have shown, our attributions are often wildly erroneous, and the errors are the sort that we would commit if we were using folk psychology to interpret the behavior of other subjects. Thus, for example, in an experiment that sparked many others, nisbett and Wilson asked subjects to examine several pairs of hose with a view to determining which pair was of the highest quality. The hose were in fact all of the same brand, but nisbett and Wilson’s subjects credited themselves with having had quite different experiences in seeing and feeling the pairs, detecting different levels of supple- ness, smoothness, and elasticity. Moved by the experimenters’ initial instruction, which presupposed that there really were objective differences in the pairs of hose, the subjects confabulated experiences that registered those “differences” (nisbett and Wilson 1977). I have three concerns about this new picture. first, although I was originally was quite taken by the idea that we obtain names of mental representations by redeployment, I now think that there is an alternative that must be taken seriously. As we saw in section 2, thoughts are distinct from the events in phe- nomenal consciousness with which they are often confused. It follows from this there are two views one can take about the inputs to the introspective processes that produce names of thoughts: the inputs may be thoughts themselves, but equally, they may be the auditory images that are the phenomenal shadows of thoughts. now if thoughts themselves are the inputs to introspective processes, it is natural to suppose that the second order mental states that represent them are the results of redeployment. What could be simpler and more straightforward than obtaining a name for t by prefixing the operator the thought that to t itself? On the other hand, if the inputs to introspective processes are auditory images, the names of thoughts could not be formed by redeployment. Auditory images are repre- sentations of speech. Accordingly, redeployed auditory images would be representations of representations of speech, not representations of thoughts about the world at large. It is no doubt possible to specify plenty of computational processes that take representations of speech as inputs and yield representations of thoughts as outputs, especially if the representations of speech are concerned with syntactic and semantic properties as well as phonological structure, but redeployment is not one of them. Second, I have doubts about the principle Goldman uses to distinguish between occa- sions when the first, perception‐like introspective procedure is applicable and occasions when the second, theory‐dependent procedure is applicable. According to the principle, the first procedure is applied to an occurrent attitude when and only when the attitude is an episode in consciousness. This seems wrong to me. Introspection is always retrospec- tive: we cannot form introspective beliefs about mental events at the very same times as the events are occurring, so there is always a delay of some sort, even if only of a few hundred milliseconds. (Goldman is committed to acknowledging this, given that the pro- cesses he posits are partially perceptual in character, and given that there is always a time‐ lag between an event and the perception to which it gives rise.) Hence, introspection must make use of working memory. But this means that whether introspection makes use of the first procedure or the second procedure depends on how much of the target event is retained in working memory. If the whole event is retained, then introspection can pro- ceed by way of redeployment and feature detection; but if only a fragment is retained, GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 273 then it must resort to theory‐dependent interpretation. In sum, whether an introspective procedure is applicable depends not on whether the target event was conscious, but rather on how much of it is retained. This point has an important implication concerning the scope of Goldman’s first procedure. The capacity of working memory is quite limited. (It can be extended by chunking‐procedures or by active rehearsal in the phonological loop, but these require attention and effort and are not involved in routine processing.) In view of this fact, it seems likely that in normal cases only fragments of thoughts will be retained, with the result that the inputs to introspective processes will be mere fragments of thoughts, and the further result that the subject will have to resort to theory‐dependent interpretation to arrive at attributions that do justice to complexities of content and logical form. If this is right, then Goldman’s first procedure won’t take us very far. Moreover, an introspect- ing agent must rely significantly more on theory‐dependent interpretation when the target is a series of thoughts rather than a single thought. In such cases, doing justice to the target will be like reconstructing a journal article from a frugal list of keywords. I find this conclusion to be consistent with everyday experience. When I ask myself, “What have I just been thinking about?” the answer initially just consists of a word or two, usually from the thought that has occurred most recently. I can use these words as a basis for attributing a thought, or perhaps a whole series of thoughts, but in my experience, the process seems more like a reconstruction rather than a direct read‐out from memory. Third, I worry about the structural principle that the processes that produce aware- ness of the representational components of attitudes are separate from the processes that produce awareness of attitude‐types. Thus, as Alex Byrne has emphasized in several important papers (see, for example, Byrne 2012), the representational component of an attitude can contain a conceptual marker that uniquely determines the attitude type. Consider the following judgments: It would be good to do A. It would be rewarding to do A. It would be fun to do A. It would be interesting to do A. It would be amusing to do A. It would give me pleasure to do A. It would be cool to do A. It would be intellectually satisfying to do A. It would be delightful to do A. It would make me happy to do A. It is desirable to do A. It seems that a judgment of any of these forms might be the representational component of a desire. Indeed, it is arguable that if a judgment of one of these forms is accompanied by the appropriate dispositional properties, such as the disposition to perform A if an oppor- tunity should arise, the resulting complex state is an occurrent desire to do A. But if we agree to this, then we should also agree that a process could reliably produce introspective 274 GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd ascriptions of the desire to do A given only judgments of the forms in question as inputs. There would be no need for the process to compare content‐independent features of the state against a list of intrinsic properties of desires. It might be objected that it is possible to judge, for example, that it would be fun to do A without actually desiring to do A, and that as a result, an introspective process that took such judgments as inputs and yielded attributions of desire as outputs would not be reli- able. This objection has some force, but I think it can be met by distinguishing between hot desires and cool desires. If an agent genuinely judges a type of activity to be fun, then, it seems, the agent must at least be disposed to experience some temptation to engage in the activity in situations in which doing so is known to carry no cost. That is enough for a cool desire. It might also be objected that it is impossible to know whether it would be fun to do A without forming a representation of A and taking note of intrinsic features of one’s emo- tional response to the representation. On this view, the judgment that it would be fun to do A presupposes a Goldmanian perception‐like awareness of the intrinsic features of a psychological state. But this objection can also be met, for it isn’t plausible that we come to know that an action would be fun by an introspective process. It seems much more likely that when we judge that it would be fun to do A, we do so because certain features F1,…, Fn have been associated with fun in the past, and we notice that A has F1,…, Fn. We don’t appreciate that it would be fun to do A by looking inward at our response to A, but by looking outward at A itself. Byrne holds that in every case, we arrive at introspective knowledge of a desire by per- forming an inference from a judgment of one of the fore-listed forms. Hence, if Byrne’s view is correct, there is never any need for an inward-looking Goldmanian agency that recognizes desires as such by registering intrinsic features. now I think that Byrne over- states the applicability of his proposal. It seems that I can desire something, and know that I desire it, even when there is no accompanying judgment of one of the given forms. Thus, as in davidson’s example, I may have a sudden desire to touch someone’s elbow, and know that I do, without judging that touching the person’s elbow is desirable. Contrary to Byrne, there may be several different ways in which we arrive at introspective knowledge of desires. But it seems that inference from judgments of the fore-listed forms may be one of the ways. That is, Byrne’s model might well fit an important range of cases. If so, Goldman will at least have to narrow the scope of his very different proposal. Notes i I have tried to persuade Goldman of these claims for a number of years, beginning with an neH Summer Seminar that Robert Gordon hosted back in 1999. The effort continued in Hill 2000, which still seems to me to make a strong case for the claims. I’m delighted to have this opportunity to try again! ii To elaborate, fully fledged beliefs and other fully fledged propositional attitudes are character- ized by hyperintensionality, where this means that they possess logical structures and have con- cepts as their building blocks. (Concepts are here understood to be entities that (i) belong to GO ld MA n O n kn O W led G e O f  MI nd 275 logical categories, (ii) have truth‐conditional semantic properties like reference and denotation, and (iii) are at least as finely individuated as the meanings of words.) It follows that hyperinten- sional states are very finely individuated. What I am claiming in the text is that we could not appropriately attribute hyperintensional states to others unless we were guided in doing so by data that were also very finely individuated. More specifically, we must be guided by linguistic data. It follows from this that we have language‐based heuristics for attributing propositional attitudes that are fundamental – that aren’t entirely explainable in terms of language‐ independent heuristics. iii Authors who hold that visual phenomenology is constituted by properties of external phenom- ena fall into two groups. Some of them maintain that visual phenomenology is constituted by objective, intrinsic properties of external phenomena – that is, by properties like round. Other authors argue that it is constituted by viewpoint‐dependent properties like appears round. There is a similar division among authors who hold that auditory phenomenology is consti- tuted by properties of external phenomena. I won’t try to adjudicate these disputes here. (for discussion see Hill 2009: ch.5; 2014: ch. 12.) iv I owe this observation to eric Schwitzgebel, who once made it in the course of a conversation. References Byrne, A.

Published 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. I am pleased that Chris Hill was invited and agreed to contribute a paper on this portion of my work in philosophy of mind and cognitive science. In particular, my work on intro- spection and the role of phenomenology in introspection is easily forgotten – the product of my own failure to revisit it in recent decades. nonetheless, I must be very brief because (inter alia) I am confined to a limit of 1000 words. In the first section of Hill’s paper, he asks why theorists of mindreading are so neglectful of testimony as a route to reading other people’s mental states. Surely it is extremely common to heed what a person says, or reports, about his/her current mental state. So why does this method of mindreading so rarely figure in the philosophical literature? And is this neglect justified? My knee‐jerk reaction is to think, “Well, testimony must surely be a derivative method of mindreading, not a fundamental one. first, we must acquire concepts of the mental before we can do any mindreading; and that cannot be facilitated by testimony. Second, don’t we first have to determine that people are reliable in testifying about their own mental states before we are warranted in trusting their testimony? for both reasons, then, other methods of mindreading must be more fundamental, and they deserve the lion’s share of the discussion. To take a couple of parallel cases, people sometimes rely on the testimony of mathematicians to form beliefs about mathematical propositions and rely on testimony about physics to form beliefs about physics. nonetheless, neither the philoso- phy of mathematics nor the philosophy of physics devotes much research to the role of testimony in those domains. Obviously, this is because testimony‐based knowledge in those realms is derivative, or secondary. Why shouldn’t the same thing hold of testimony’s role in acquiring knowledge of (other people’s) mental states? reply to hill 278 R e P l Y T O   HI ll Hill’s reply is an argument for the autonomy, or semi‐autonomy, of testimony‐based mindreading. In particular, he argues for a central role of “psycholinguistic heuristics.” I don’t find this argument terribly convincing. The relevant evidence, as Hill seems to acknowledge, is not easy to come by. The acquisition of some mindreading skill emerges much earlier than developmental psychologists once believed – as early as the first year of life. This makes the putative role of psycholinguistic heuristics rather implausible. Moreover, there is a special class of mindreading tasks – that is, the recognition of emotional states from facial expressions  –  that occurs early and has many earmarks of primitiveness. (See Goldman and Sripada 2005; Goldman 2006: ch. 6; Heberlein and Adolphs 2007.) It is unlikely to be dependent on, or even intertwined with, the processing of psycholinguistic heuristics. face‐based emotion recognition is almost bound to be fundamental and/or autonomous, and prior to any role for testimony. In the second section of his paper Hill takes on my phenomenological thesis from Goldman (1993). The principal principle he extracts from that paper, and proceeds to discuss, runs as follows: (B) We are introspectively aware of our conscious mental states by virtue of being aware of their respective phenomenologies. Hill proceeds to take issue with this principle. But his main point, actually, seems to be that all use of phenomenology is restricted to auditory and articulatory imagery, and that this doesn’t work with a specific category of mental states of interest, namely, thoughts. This is a much more restricted line of criticism than I was expecting, since he actually endorses a great deal of appeal to phenomenology. The surprising part is the centrality he assigns to auditory and articulatory imagery, to the exclusion of other kinds of imagery. He endorses the following claim: The phenomenology of thought is exhaustively constituted by auditory imagery and artic- ulatory sensations in the mouth, throat, and tongue. Auditory imagery is always present; articulatory sensations are less frequent but they can be more pronounced. He implies that this claim is based on various research results, but it is hard to find clear support for it, especially the claimed “exhaustiveness” of the specified forms of phenom- enology. Here I proffer a single test of his exhaustiveness thesis to illustrate my doubts. Consider a thought that consists in an occurrent, conscious belief, indeed, a very firmly held belief. The subject knows that this is a very confident belief. How does he know this? I suggest that strength of (conscious) doxastic conviction has a characteristic phenomenology, so that one has introspective access to the (approximate) place on this scale of a particular belief. Such a phenomenological scale, I contend, isn’t associated with any of the perceptual modalities: neither visual, tactile, olfactory, nor (more pertinently) auditory or articulatory. So Hill’s generalization is wrong. (notice that I say nothing about awareness of the content of the belief. As Hill explains earlier, on my story representational content is not accessed via any phenomenology.) R e P l Y T O   HI ll 279 Here is a final comment on Hill’s material that is orthogonal to anything he directly addresses but relates to another part of my work in this general territory. According to the cognitive‐science based work he cites, imagery of one sort or another plays an extremely prominent role in self‐awareness. let me just point out that imagery is a product of the imagination. And imagining is also properly thought of as simulation, a theme for which I argue at length in Simulating Minds (Goldman 2006) and elsewhere. So I am happy to have simulation (not so labeled) figure centrally in Hill’s account. References Goldman, A.I. (1993) Consciousness, folk psychology, and cognitive science.

Under Influence Is Altercentric Bias Compatible with  Simulation Theory?i Fréd ér I q U e de V I gnemo n T A nd H U go m er CI er i 13 In many circumstances we tend to assume that other people believe or desire what we ourselves believe or desire. This has been labeled “egocentric bias.” Egocentric bias seems to be particularly true of young children. For many years, it has indeed been asserted that children under four years of age cannot adopt someone else’s perspective, as shown by their failure to pass the false‐belief task. Instead, they expect the others to act according to their own true belief. But children are not the only victims of egocentric bias. Even adults, who are supposed to have achieved sophisticated mindreading abilities, can neglect differences between their own perspective and other people’s perspective. Experts are particularly likely to suffer from a form of this problem known as the curse of knowledge: for example, business experts can fail to discount their own knowledge when predicting corporate earning forecasts by less‐informed people (Camerer et  al. 1989). Egocentric bias has been taken as evidence that our own perspective has some kind of priority: (i) developmental priority: we learn first what we believe, and only later can we judge what others believe; (ii) computational priority: it is less cognitively demanding to judge what we believe than what others believe; (iii) epistemic priority: we have a privileged access to our own beliefs that we do not have for other people’s beliefs. One of the assets of the simulation theory, as defended by Alvin Goldman in many papers and in his book Simulating Minds, is its ability to explain egocentric bias, and more generally the priority of first‐person mindreading (self‐ascription of mental states) over third‐person mindreading (ascription of mental states to other people). In particular, Goldman accounts for egocentric bias in terms of failure to quarantine one’s own perspective. When one tries to understand other people, one puts oneself in their shoes. To do so, one pretends to be in the same situation and to have their beliefs and desires. und E r I n F l u E n CE 281 This involves inhibiting one’s own beliefs and desires. But one can neglect or fail to do so. This results in egocentric errors. This is not to say that we systematically fail to understand other people and forget that they can have a different perspective. If it were the case, then it would be highly difficult, if not impossible, to communicate, cooperate or compete with them. In those situations, we need to take the other person’s perspective and to inhibit our own. But can the other’s per- spective furtively intrude even when no reason seems to require it, or even when it is detri- mental for us? We shall see a series of evidence of what has been called altercentric bias (Samson et al. 2010; Apperly 2011): other people’s beliefs can unduly influence us even when they are wrong. At first sight, altercentric bias questions first‐person priority. In particular, it may appear as incompatible with simulation‐based accounts of third‐person mindreading. We shall argue, on the contrary, that the simulationist framework enables confusions between self and others that go both ways: taking one’s beliefs for the other’s beliefs (egocentric bias) and vice versa, taking the other’s beliefs for one’s beliefs (altercentric bias). We shall then see how the risk of such confusion may be disadvantageous from an evolutionary perspective, ques- tioning thus the evolutionary plausibility of the simulation theory. 1 When the Self Takes Over For many years, the debate in the mindreading literature was framed in either/or terms: third‐person mindreading results either from theorizing or from simulating. Goldman convincingly argued in favor of the latter. By putting ourselves in the other’s shoes and running offline our own cognitive resources, we can simulate or re‐create other people’s mental states. Since then, several hybrid views have been proposed. As well argued by Goldman (2006), simulation and theorizing need not be in competition. rather, they may cooperate (if for instance, a theory is used to select the initial pretend inputs). Furthermore, some instantiations of mindreading may result from simulation only, whereas others may result from theorizing only. nonetheless, even in its hybrid versions, at least one disagree- ment remains. In a nutshell, the priority of first‐person mindreading over third‐person mindreading is at the core of Goldman’s view, whereas most theory theories and rational- ity theories do not posit asymmetry between first‐person and third‐person mindreading (see for instance, Gopnik 1993). When analyzing the relation between first‐ and third‐person mindreading, one can ask two questions: (i) do they rely on the same psychological mechanisms or processes? (ii) if they rely on different mechanisms, are they fully independent or does one require the other? The debate is best illuminated if we compare Alvin Goldman and Peter Carruthers, who sit at two opposite sides of the debate. According to Goldman (1992, 1993, 2006), different processes are at stake in first‐person and third‐person mindreading, with the latter depending on the former. Self‐knowledge relies on a kind of inner sense or intro- spection, which utilizes an innate code in the language of thought, whose basic elements are caused by the various mental state types. On the other hand, third‐person mindreading consists in taking another person’s perspective and in operating offline on the initial pre- tend states to generate further states, which can then be ascribed to the other person. 282 und E r I n F l u E n CE Consequently, one needs to access one’s own pretend states to be able to understand other people. There is a primacy of first‐person mindreading over third‐person mindreading. In contrast, according to Carruthers (2009, 2011), first‐ and third‐person mindreading do not result from different mechanisms as far as propositional attitudes are concerned. rather, they both involve interpretation. In particular, first‐person mindreading consists in swift unconscious self‐ interpretation. Hence, there is just a single faculty involved in both types of mindreading, using essentially the same type of inputs. There is no priority of self‐ knowledge of propositional attitudes. now a common complaint from the psychology side of the mindreading literature has been that one cannot empirically settle the debate between simulation theory and its rivals (see, for example, Apperly 2011). However, one may suggest that the analysis of mindreading biases offers a promising way to test the various theories, including the hypothesis of the (a)symmetry of first‐person and third‐person mindreading. More particularly, according to Goldman (2006), only the simulation theory can account for egocentric bias. The clearest example of egocentric bias can be found in young children. In the classic version of the false‐belief task, children observe the puppet Maxi putting a chocolate bar in the kitchen cupboard and leaving the room. Meanwhile Maxi’s mother comes in the kitchen and puts the chocolate bar in the fridge. Then Maxi comes back. Children are asked where Maxi will search for his chocolate bar when he comes back: in the cupboard or in the fridge. It has been repeatedly found that children under four years of age typi- cally answer that Maxi will search in the fridge. They assume that Maxi will act the way they themselves will act. In other words, they are victims of egocentric bias. But children are not the only ones to be sensitive to such bias. For example, Keysar and his colleagues (2003) instructed participants to move certain visible objects around in a grid. Before receiving instructions, participants hid an object in a bag, such that the experimenter would not know its identity. The descriptions that the experimenter used to refer to a mutually visible object could sometimes match more closely the hidden object. Although they clearly knew that the experimenter did not know the identity of the hidden object, they often took it as the referent of her description, sometimes even attempting to comply with the instruction by actually moving the bag itself. There are many other examples of egocentric errors both in experimental conditions and in everyday life (for a review, see Goldman 2006: ch. 7; Apperly 2011: ch. 5). no matter how old we are, we can sometimes forget that other people do not share our beliefs and desires. Egocentric errors have been taken as evidence of the priority of first‐person mindread- ing over third‐person mindreading, which seems in line with the simulation theory. When taking another’s perspective, the subject can never fully pretend to be the other, that is, to have all the other’s mental states. rather, the offline use of psychological processes takes as inputs some pretend states but also some of the subject’s own mental states (nichols and Stich 2003). This is not a problem if the other shares the subject’s mental states, if they correspond to some commonsense assumptions for example. But this can lead to mindreading errors if the other has different beliefs or desires, as in the false‐belief task. It is then especially important for the subject to quarantine her own mental states. Failure to do so leads to egocentric errors. und E r I n F l u E n CE 283 While egocentric errors appear as a direct consequence of the simulation theory, this is less so of the theory theory and the rationality theory, the two other main rivals to the simulation theory (Goldman 2006). nonetheless, proponents of these latter views may claim that we use folk psychology that includes a “like‐me” rule among other psycho- logical laws. On this rule, the subject assumes that other people’s mental states are like her own mental states. This may be plausible in children, although we shall see that even young infants do not always apply this rule. But Goldman argues that it is less intuitive in adults, and yet, they are also victims of egocentric errors even in simple situations in which one might expect them to make no error, as in that of Keysar and his colleagues. However, one may not be as confident as Goldman that egocentric errors can be used as an argument in favor of the simulation theory. On the one hand, some results inter- preted in terms of egocentric mindreading errors may just reflect the lack of third‐ person mindreading. For example, one may suggest that in the example of Keysar and his col- leagues (2003), participants do not try to understand the experimenter’s communicative intention about which object she has in mind; rather, they merely match a physical description to the object that fits best. As concluded by the authors themselves, “under these circumstances, directly computing what another person knows or does not know at a given moment might be more trouble than it is worth” (Keysar et al. 2003; 39). If this interpretation is correct, these specific results are not relevant for third‐person mindread- ing because the participants do not use a mindreading strategy. In addition, even for ego- centric errors that result from mindreading errors and cannot be reduced in such a way, it is not clear that the simulation theory only can explain them. For example, Wallin (2011) interprets them within the framework of the rationality theory. On this view, egocentric errors are merely a collateral damage of an efficient heuristic. It is indeed sometimes rational to attribute one’s own mental states to other people. Hence, it seems that one cannot use egocentric errors to settle the debate between simulation theory and its rivals. The simulation theory, however, has to face a more important problem than the fact that other theories can account for egocentric errors. Indeed recent results seem to question the priority of first‐person mindreading. As we shall see now, we can also make altercentric mindreading errors. But can simulation theory account for them? 2 When the Other Takes Over The landscape of the experimental study of mindreading has greatly changed over last few years. In particular, new versions of the classic false‐belief task have appeared, show- ing that egocentric bias may be present only in explicit verbal behavior, but less so in more implicit behavioral cues (for a review, see Baillargeon et al. 2010). In new versions of the false‐belief task, children are not asked questions about the puppet Maxi. rather, the experimenter analyzes either the direction of their gaze (which reveals where children visually anticipate Maxi will search for the candy bar), or its duration (which reveals if they are surprised by the location at which Maxi looks at). Both implicit measures show that infants in the second year of life rightly expect Maxi to look at the cupboard: they are less egocentric than expected. As we shall see now, the same may be true of adults as well. 284 und E r I n F l u E n CE How do you describe spatial relations between objects? The book is on the right of the bottle, you might spontaneously say, and this is the case from your own perspective. However, a recent study showed that one might spontaneously switch to another indi- vidual’s perspective, even when the situation did not require it (Tversky and Hard 2009). When participants saw a photograph of a bottle and a book on a table, with a man seated behind the table, about a quarter of them described the spatial relations from the man’s perspective (that is, the book is on the left of the bottle in a reference frame centered on the man), although they had no interaction with the man depicted in the photograph. Along the same line, it was found that participants used different strategies to judge hand laterality when two participants facing each other simultaneously performed the task and when only one was doing the task while the other closed her eyes (Böckler et al. 2011). The analysis of the reaction time relative to the angle of rotation showed that the partici- pant represented the hand from an egocentric frame when alone, and from an allocentric frame in a joint situation. Yet, the fact that another individual was performing the same task at the same time had no relevance for the task itself. The participants themselves were not aware that the other’s presence had affected their performance. Thus, the presence of other people, with whom one does not interact in any way and which should be normally irrelevant here, can lead to a switch of spatial reference frame. not only can we spontaneously take another person’s visuospatial perspective, but we can also lose our own perspective in the process. This is so even when the other has a false belief, while we have a true belief, as illustrated by the following study. In Kovács et al. (2010), participants see a video showing a small story with a Smurf looking at a ball, which disappears behind a screen. The ball can then reappear or not, and it can be when the Smurf is still looking or is no longer there. At the end, the screen is lowered and partici- pants must press a button as soon as they detect the ball. It was found that participants were as quick to detect the ball (i) when they expected the ball and (ii) when the Smurf expected the ball, although they themselves did not expect it. ii Participants therefore took into account what the Smurf believed, although it was in contradiction with their own true belief and it was not required by the task. Finally, participants replied more quickly even if the Smurf was absent when the screen was removed. Similar results were found with seven‐month infants. A further study showed that another’s belief could influence our judgment even when we are explicitly required to focus on our own perspective (Samson et al. 2010). Participants saw on a screen a room with an avatar and red discs displayed on one or two walls. In one condition, the avatar could see all the discs in the room. In another condition, the avatar could see only some of them (for example, she had her back turned to a wall with discs). Participants were then asked how many discs there were either from their own perspective or from the avatar’s perspective. Interestingly, even when participants were explicitly asked to judge based on their own perspective, their answer was affected by the avatar’s perspective. More precisely, they took significantly more time to respond and they made more errors. In all these studies, another individual’s perspective (or belief) affected the partici- pants one way or the other, although it did not seem to be directly relevant for the task. One may draw two distinct conclusions on the basis of these results, what we call the und E r I n F l u E n CE 285 automaticity hypothesis and the altercentricity hypothesis. On the one hand, these results indicate that we mindread other people even when nothing seems to require it. One may then take these results as evidence in favor of the automaticity of some components of mindreading (Kovács et al. 2010; Samson et al. 2010; Apperly, 2011). According to the automaticity hypothesis, we cannot help but mindread people around us. On the other hand, these results indicate that another’s perspective seems to dominate our own per- spective in some circumstances. The output of third‐person mindreading to some extent can unduly influence our mental processes and behavior. According to the altercentricity hypothesis, the other’s perspective can intrude in our mental life. One may then be tempted to compare these results with the Stroop effect. Although irrelevant, the color the word refers to interferes with the correct naming of the color of the ink. Shall we then conclude like Tversky and Hard (2009: 129) that in some circumstances, “taking the other’s perspective appears to be more natural and spontaneous than taking one’s own”? A few words of caution are necessary at this stage, as is always the case if one wants to draw theoretical conclusions upon the basis of empirical results. First, it is worth noting that there are important differences among the studies described above. In particular, it is not clear that they all involve a mindreading component (for example, Tversky and Hard 2009). In addition, Böckler et al. (2011) highlight the importance of joint attention, but it is questionable whether the other studies involve joint attention. Finally, one may want to distinguish between altercentric bias (adopting another’s perspective when unnecessary) and altercentric error (adopting another’s perspective when detrimental). When partici- pants describe the relation between the book and the bottle, they display altercentric bias. When participants judge that they see only one disc rather than the two they can see from their own perspective, they make altercentric errors. One may also want to question to what extent the other’s presence (whether it is a man in a photograph, a virtual avatar or a Smurf) can appear as relevant in these studies. It is true that the task (such as counting the discs in the virtual room) does not require taking into account the other’s perspective. But subjects are aware that they participate in an experiment, in which in general each detail matters. Hence, third‐person mindreading may be motivated by the experimental context. If so, then to what extent can the results described above be taken as evidence of the automaticity of mindreading? It is all the more difficult to answer this question that the notion of automaticity is often left undefined. More interesting may be the claim that third‐person mindreading is mandatory. Arguably, a process is mandatory if it is stimulus‐driven (passive stimulation) and immune to inter- ference. But the results so far do not suffice to show that third‐person mindreading is purely stimulus‐driven, independent of the context. The automaticity hypothesis, however, is not at the core of our interest here. rather, we are interested in the altercentricity hypothesis, and its implication for simulation‐ based accounts of mindreading. Even if the specific context of these studies can account for the apparently unnecessary third‐person mindreading, it cannot explain the fact that to some extent the other’s perspective or belief seems to take over the participants’ own perspective or belief. One may, however, regret the weakness of the altercentric effects in these studies. For instance, Samson et al. reported an increase in error rate due to altercentric bias, but only in two out of their three experiments. In these two 286 und E r I n F l u E n CE experiments, participants had to shift their responses, answering sometimes from their own perspective and sometimes from that of the avatar. Given that the participants were facing a speed–accuracy tradeoff (participants had to react as quickly as possible), it is not very surprising that they would sometimes make mistakes, such as taking the avatar’s perspective when they had not been asked to do so on a specific question. By contrast, in the third experiment, participants never had to take the avatar’s perspec- tive. They then stopped making mistakes.iii Further experiments are thus needed to make the altercentric bias more salient. nonetheless, these preliminary results invite us to consider in more detail the notion of altercentric bias, in particular within the simu- lationist framework. 3 Altercentric Errors in Simulation If egocentric errors cannot settle the debate between simulation theory and its rivals, then altercentric errors may work better. This time, however, the empirical evidence seems to run against Goldman’s view.iv The fact that both egocentric bias and altercentric bias exist depending on the situation may indicate symmetry between first person and third person, which is fully in line with theory theories. Furthermore, altercentric errors seem to reflect a priority of third‐person mindreading over first‐ person mindreading in some circum- stances. How is this compatible with the simulation theory? Since Goldman in his hybrid view acknowledges that we sometimes use theorizing rather than simulating in our under- standing of other people, he can reply that altercentric effects occur only in these specific cases when we do not attempt to take another’s perspective. nonetheless, this reply seems slightly unsatisfactory and hardly compatible with Goldman’s overall emphasis on the first‐person. We shall propose here another answer for proponents of simulation theory, which offers an account of altercentric effects within the simulationist framework itself. Furthermore, we shall argue that far from being incompatible with altercentric bias, simulation opens the door to such bias. It is first important to precisely understand what is at stake in altercentric errors. In particular, one should not assume that altercentric bias is the mere opposite of egocentric bias. The two do not refer to one and the same phenomenon with a change of direction (from self to other in egocentric bias and from other to self in altercentric bias). Egocentric errors result from failure in third‐person mindreading. The subject mistakenly ascribes to the target her own mental state. In contrast, in altercentric errors, the subject does cor- rectly understand the target’s perspective or belief. rather, the mistake consists (i) to some extent in mindreading the target when not required by the task, which may appear as an unnecessary cognitive cost, and more importantly (ii) in being unduly influenced by the target, especially when the target has a false belief (cf. the Smurf ’s belief that the ball is there in Kovács et al.). In other words, whereas egocentric bias reveals under‐use of third‐person mindreading, altercentric bias reveals overuse of third‐ person mindreading. If now we compare egocentric and altercentric errors within the simulationist framework, we can see that they correspond to different stages in the simulative process. To recapitu- late, the simulative process can be articulated into four stages: und E r I n F l u E n CE 287 1 Input selection: selection of the information both about the context and about the target that is relevant for the simulation. 2 Offline use of psychological processes: emotional process, decision‐making process, reasoning process and so forth are run offline fed by the selected inputs. 3 Output of psychological processes: the offline use of psychological processes gives rise to emotions, intentions, beliefs and so forth. 4 Ascription of the output to the target: emotions, intentions, beliefs and so forth are then attributed to the target. As previously argued, egocentric errors result from inappropriate input selection. rather than pretending to have the target’s beliefs and desires, one takes one’s own beliefs and desires to feed the simulative process despite the fact that they are irrelevant. We will now argue that the four‐stage model can not only account for altercentric errors, but it actually invites them. In particular, the third stage leaves open the possibility of confus- ing self and other. Goldman (2006: 186) raises two questions about the simulative process: who is the subject of the pretend states? And what are the tags associated with them? He replies: “The mentalizer is the subject of those states (…) On the other hand, she can label, or tag, her pretend states as belonging to somebody else.” What is important here is the fact that at stage 3, I am the subject of the output of the offline use of the relevant psychological process. For example, in the Smurf study, when I put myself into the shoes of the Smurf who sees the ball and then leaves, I myself entertain the (pretend) belief that the ball is behind the screen. Hence, I am the person who expects the ball to be there, even if I saw the ball rolling out from behind the screen. We argue that the temporary intrusion of the subject in the understanding of other people at the time of the pretense renders possible altercentric errors. More precisely, we would like to speculate about two possible descrip- tions of how things may go wrong. As we shall see, these two scenarios are all the more plausible as they can occur in other cognitive domains. First, the simulative process is disrupted. Arguably, we can conceive that the “Smurf tag” is left out for one reason or another (stage 4), still to be determined. That leaves open the possibility that I label the pretend belief as my own belief. It is then normal that this belief guides my behavior. The scenario of tagging failure is not unheard of in cogni- tive science. One may draw a parallel with action misattribution (see Jeannerod, 2003).v Tagging failure is also well illustrated by emotional contagion, in contrast to empathy (for further details, see Vignemont and Jacob, 2012). In empathy, I share your anxiety, but I am aware that I am in this emotional state because you are anxious. I can then ascribe anxiety to you. In emotional contagion, on the other hand, I share your anxiety, but I am not aware that you are at the origin of my feeling anxious. rather, I catch your emotion, so to speak, and appropriate it as my own. In the conceptual framework we just proposed, I fail to tag my state of anxiety as yours. These two examples, however, leave unexplained why only in some circumstances we fail to appropriately tag the other’s emotional state, action or belief. Alternatively, one may suggest that the tagging process does not need to be disturbed for altercentric errors to occur. let us imagine now that the simulative process goes 288 und E r I n F l u E n CE smoothly. My pretend belief is then associated with a Smurf tag. But my pretend belief can be erroneously taken as input to guide my behavior. If so, I act on the basis of what I pretend to believe rather than on the basis of what I actually believe. In this situation, what I pretend to believe corresponds to what the Smurf believes. Consequently, I act on the basis of someone else’s belief. This is not so different from what happens in obedience. For example, if I am a soldier, I may believe that it is a bad idea to attack during the night, but my officer believes it is the right thing to do. I then act on the basis of my officer’s belief rather than my own. unlike obedience, however, altercentric error does not result from a decision – more or less voluntary – that I take. vi In other words, it seems unlikely (although not impossible) that I choose to adopt the Smurf ’s perspective while it runs against my own. Why do I then act on the basis of what the Smurf believes? Here is one possible scenario. let us imagine that the state I am in is miscategorized as a standard belief rather than a pretend belief. We know that errors can happen in the categorization of propositional attitudes (see the literature on source monitoring, cf. Johnson et al. 1993). For example, one may take one’s dream for reality. If my pretend belief is no longer acknowledged as belonging to the “pretend box” in nichols and Stich’s terminology, then it is no longer isolated from my executive system. rather, it can play the same functional role as standard belief, including guiding my behavior. To conclude, altercentric bias is compatible with the simulation theory. The first person is so much at the core of third‐person mindreading processes that one can actually forget that one is doing third‐person mindreading. While this removes one possible dif- ficulty for the simulation theory, it also brings a new threat. If the simulation theory does indeed invite confusion between self and other, one may wonder if the simulation theory is desirable from an evolutionary perspective.vii One may suggest that the evolution should have selected a mindreading process that prevents as much as possible interpersonal influence, including altercentric errors. 4 Altercentric Bias from an Evolutionary Perspective A long philosophical tradition, marked most notably by reid (1764) and Hume (1748), has tried to answer the following question: do we – or can we – naturally trust what other people tell us? recently, psychologists have started to weigh in. For instance, daniel Gilbert has purportedly shown that “you can’t not believe everything you read.” People would first accept all communicated information before being able to question it in a second processing step (Gilbert et al. 1993). When the second processing cannot run its normal course, people may accept information that they would otherwise realize is false. While not identical, these findings and the altercentric bias share an interesting feature: information derived from someone else has an influence on us despite the availability of a negative assessment of that information. In this sense, both results suggest that consider- ing information derived from others as false and maintaining the separation with other beliefs deemed to be true are effortful tasks that can easily be derailed. These results thus support the view that trust towards information derived from others is a more natural stance than distrust. und E r I n F l u E n CE 289 In 2001, dan Sperber shone an evolutionary light on this debate (fittingly enough, in a special issue of Philosophical Topics dedicated to the work of Alvin Goldman). From an evo- lutionary perspective, it does not make much sense to be naturally or overly trusting. Individuals’ interests very rarely overlap perfectly. As a result, even when they have an incentive to cooperate and communicate, some component of competition is retained. In the case of cooperation, it means that cooperators are often better off “cheating”: reaping the fruits of cooperation while making the least effort possible. Cooperators have to be attuned to the existence of such cheaters if cooperation is to remain stable (Cosmides 1989). Similarly speakers can influence listeners in ways that would only benefit the speakers and may be detrimental to the listeners – in other words, communication allows lying, cheating, manipulating. If communication is to remain stable, listeners have to be wary of misleading information communicated by speakers (dawkins and Krebs 1978; Krebs and dawkins 1984). To put it simply, individuals who could too easily be led to accept wrong beliefs – death caps are edible, lions like to be petted – would not have passed on their gullibility to many descendants. Accordingly, it should not be a surprise that Gilbert et al.’s results – along with other instances of surreptitious influence such as subliminal persuasion – have been heavily criticized. Further experiments have shown that people can be led to accept information they should reject only if participants have little previous knowledge on that topic and if the information is rather irrelevant (see, Mercier 2013). Prima facie, the altercentric bias also lends support to the view that people can be unduly influenced by others. However, in the experiments reviewed above, there is no communication. Instead, participants are influenced by what evolutionary biologists would call a cue: the individual being observed (for example, the Smurf) is not trying to influence the observer in any way; it is the observer who does all the work (Scott‐Phillips 2008). Through communicative or non‐communicative behavior, individuals could lead others to think that they entertain false beliefs. These false beliefs would then have an impact on the behavior of the “victim” even if she knows they are false. The authors of the studies are aware of the dangers that can arise from altercentric bias: “The finding that others’ beliefs can be similarly accessible as our own beliefs might seem problematic for an individual, because it may make one’s behavior susceptible to others’ beliefs that do not reliably reflect the current state of affairs” (Kovács et al. 2010: 1834). The problem is that we have seen that simulative processes open the door to such interpersonal influence by allowing confusion between self and other. From an evolution- ary perspective, this danger could be so great as to shed doubt on the validity of the simu- lation theory: “blind” trust is not advantageous from an evolutionary perspective. Interpersonal influence must be limited and under control. Proponents of the simulation theory may want to reply that altercentric errors are not more of a problem than egocen- tric errors. To avoid being victims of egocentric errors, one must quarantine’s one’s own beliefs and desires. Similarly, it may be suggested that to avoid being victims of altercen- tric errors, one must quarantine one’s own pretend beliefs and desires. If well quarantined, one’s own pretend beliefs and desires should not contaminate other cognitive domains. They should have no effect on executive control or decision‐making. Most probably, quarantine plays a major role in preventing altercentric errors, but does it suffice from an evolutionary perspective? It can suffice if quarantining is a reliable mechanism. However, 290 und E r I n F l u E n CE the pervasiveness of egocentric errors seems to indicate to the contrary. So we can ask: are we endowed with specific mechanisms designed to ward off manipulation attempts? Are they required to the same extent by communicative and non‐communicative situations? Most studies of the dangers of interpersonal influence have focused on linguistic interactions. Sperber and his colleagues have suggested that humans are endowed with a suite of mechanisms designed to ward off the dangers  –  mentioned above  –  raised by communicated information (Sperber et al. 2010). They point out that people should exert epistemic vigilance when they deal with communicated information. Thus, people adjust their trust according to the perceived benevolence and competence of the speaker (Mascaro and Sperber 2009), they tend to reject information that conflicts with their previous beliefs (Mercier 2012) and they evaluate arguments aimed at persuading them (Mercier and Sperber 2011). By contrast, such vigilance is hardly necessary when it comes to our own perceptual or inferential mechanisms, which were designed for our better good and proved to be remarkably reliable. Given the preponderant role played by language in human interaction, the focus on linguistic communication is quite justified. Yet people can influence each other through other communicative means, even if they are not ostensive like language. In particular, the expression of emotion is a powerful mean of communication. Since most of the informa- tion we derive from other people is acquired through communication, the dangers of being misinformed or manipulated through communication are also more important than those raised by non‐communicative influence. Still, these dangers do exist. Such non‐ communicative influence can be passive – as when the observer attributes a belief to the Smurf simply because he is gazing in a given direction  –  or active  –  for instance, the Smurf could have been intentionally gazing in that direction so that the observer attrib- utes to him a given belief. If people are not careful about the information they infer from other people’s non‐communicative behavior, they can easily be misled. A simple example will be used to illustrate the differences and commonalities between the treatment of information derived from communicative and non‐communicative behavior. In particu- lar, it will show that communicative behavior is more likely to change people’s mind than non‐communicative behavior. Imagine there is a game in the newspaper with a trick question and a reward for the people who send in the correct answer. Paul’s roommate, lara, has written down an answer on her copy of the newspaper, but Paul thinks that the answer is something else. Paul then faces several options: 1 He judges that lara believes that is the correct answer and either a He changes his mind about the answer b He believes she has made a mistake. 2 He changes his mind about what lara actually believes and either a Attributes to lara the intention to mislead him: she does not actually believe that is the correct answer but wants him to believe it. b Changes his interpretation of lara’s behavior (lara never thought that that was the correct answer; for instance she was just writing a possible answer on her way to figuring out the definitive answer.) und E r I n F l u E n CE 291 now compare that situation with one in which lara tells Paul: “I think the answer is X.” Obviously, there are cases in which ostensive communication will be much more ambiguous than in the present example but overall the attributions that result from osten- sive communication tend to be much less ambiguous than those resulting from the obser- vation of non‐communicative behaviors. Otherwise communication would be mostly moot. Option (iib) becomes much less likely in the case of communication, and the other interpretations are thus necessarily strengthened. There is no reason that (ib) or (iia) should be more likely in the case of communication than in the case of non‐communica- tive behavior, and so Paul is more likely to change his mind when he has grounded his attribution in communicative behavior. This is so not because he trusts lara’s competence or benevolence more, but simply because the interpretation is more ambiguous. In addition, communication gives listeners an extra reason to change their mind because of the benevolence of the communicator: “By the very act of making an assertion, the communicator indicates that she is committing herself to providing the addressee with genuine information, and she intends his recognition of this commitment to give him a motive for accepting a content that he would not otherwise have sufficient reasons to accept” (Sperber et al. 2010: 366). let us imagine that Paul sees lara carefully writing down her answer in the newspaper and leaving it on the table where he takes his breakfast, opened on the page of the game. Paul can now be quite sure that lara wants him to believe that she believes that the answer is X. However, Paul still does not have the extra reason to accept X as the correct answer as he has when lara tells him “I think the answer is X.” For lara’s non‐communicative behavior to provide as strong a reason as her communicative behavior to accept the intended belief, lara should not be able to deny wanting to influence Paul, which should make her less likely to try to trick him. Furthermore, Paul must be aware of that, which provides him with a reason to accept lara’s belief. But how often does such a far‐fetched scenario (Paul has to know that lara knows that he knows that she wants him to believe that she believes that the correct answer is X) happen? Other types of commitments can replace the intrinsic level of commitment found in communication. For instance, lara could ask Paul to mail her answer to the newspaper (without saying what it is). If Paul looked up lara’s answer then, he would have a good reason to believe that it is actually what she believes to be the correct answer. The fact that extra proofs of commitment are necessary to make non‐communicative behavior as credible or more credible than com- municative behavior only demonstrates that communicative behavior is usually under- stood as naturally committing the speaker. Communication makes things much simpler (at least when it cannot be denied that communication took place at all, which is usually the case with verbal communication). We have already seen two reasons why communicative behavior is more likely to influ- ence other people than non‐communicative behavior. A third reason could be an intrinsic suspicion of non‐communicative meta‐representational intentions. When we think that someone intends us to think (or do) something, and yet the person does not rely on com- munication to achieve her end, we are entitled to doubt that her intentions are pure: otherwise, why would she not use the much more convenient way of transmitting infor- mation that is communication? 292 und E r I n F l u E n CE To conclude, altercentric effects point to an interesting but understudied phenomenon: the possibility of influence through non‐communicative behavior. We have tried to show here that the mechanisms of epistemic vigilance that are used to deal with communicated information can also be recruited to treat influence through non‐communicative behavior. Even if the same mechanisms are used in both the communicative and non‐communicative cases, the dynamics differ, making non‐communicative behavior less likely to successfully influence people than communicative behavior. In addition, there is a further difference between undue interpersonal influence in communication and altercentric errors, as it is illustrated in the Smurf study for example. The difference is not only between communica- tive and non‐communicative effects. The difference is also between intentional and non‐ intentional effects. lara may be trying to influence Paul. But the Smurf is not trying to influence the observer to his advantage. The subject is misled but the Smurf is not respon- sible for this. If altercentric errors are merely the consequences of a failure to quarantine one’s pretend states, then they can be seen as a rather innocuous computational bug, not more dangerous than when people make small mistakes in their understanding of the phys- ical world. Furthermore, it is hard to see how individuals could come to make the best of the loophole in the quarantine process in order to exert undue influence on each other. Hence, it is true that the simulation theory makes possible altercentric errors, which is not optimal from an evolutionary perspective, but it remains to be shown that this could be voluntarily used by others to manipulate the subject. 5 Conclusion recent findings on altercentric bias have opened a new promising way to investigate the cognitive basis of third‐person mindreading. More needs to be done on both the experi- mental and the theoretical sides. Yet, preliminary evidence of altercentric bias already raises fundamental questions about the priority of the first person. Here we have argued that contrary to what one may expect, altercentric bias is not incompatible with simula- tion‐based accounts. On the other hand, we have claimed that mindreading mechanisms should not allow too easily such bias from an evolutionary perspective. Notes i We would like to thank Stephen Butterfill, Pierre Jacob and Corrado Sinigaglia for their useful comments. We also wish to acknowledge support of a grant from the French ministry of re- search (Anr‐BlAn SOCOdEV). ii In this key condition, participants see the Smurf hiding a ball behind a screen, the Smurf leaving the room and the ball rolling out from behind the screen and leaving the room. They then see the ball going back behind the screen in the Smurf ’s absence. Thus, the Smurf falsely believes that the ball is still behind the screen and the participants rightly believe that there is no ball. iii Moreover, while reaction times still increased when the avatar’s perspective was inconsistent with the participants’ perspective, the increase was small. Interestingly, in the Smurf study, the reac- tion time did not increase when the Smurf ’s belief was inconsistent with the participants’ belief. und E r I n F l u E n CE 293 iv While finishing the paper, we discovered that Alvin Goldman was simultaneously writing on Kovacs’ study. His focus is primarily on the results with infants, which he takes as evidence in favor of the simulation sheory. See Goldman and Jordan (2013) for details. v Interestingly, action misattribution, which is especially salient in patients with schizophrenia suffering from delusion of control, has been taken as a consequence of the use of simulation in action understanding. More precisely, neuroscientific evidence indicates that when observing another individual acting one mentally simulates (or “mirrors”) the other’s action. It has been argued that these motor representations shared between self and others can lead to confusion, including self‐attribution of other people’s actions. vi There are also other differences between obedience and the altercentric effects we describe, including a normative dimension. vii This threat can be generalized to any theory that predicts altercentric bias.

Frederique de Vignemont and Hugo Mercier are intrigued by recent experimental findings about “altercentric” effects and the how they bear on the simulation theory of mindreading (which I have long defended). Part of my defense of the simulation theory is based on psychological evidence of egocentric bias in mindreading. People – both children and adults – often make erroneous mental‐state attributions to others. Simulation theory explains many such errors as follows. A standard way to read another person’s mind is to construct initial states in one’s own mind that correspond to initial states of the target, and then let one’s own mind “process” these states so as to generate others. This method often works because our minds are quite a bit alike. However, it is often hard to keep one’s pretend states separated from non‐pretend, genuine states. One’s own genuine beliefs, for example, tend to “leak” into the processing even when one “knows” that the target doesn’t share that belief. This failure to “quarantine” the simulation process readily leads to erroneous attributions. This simulationist story is a particularly natural explanation of egocentric bias (which isn’t available to the rival, theory theory), and therefore lends it support. In quite recent psychological literature, a new and different kind of bias has been discovered: a so‐called altercentric bias. Studies of both adults and young children reveal that when asked to judge something from either one’s own or another’s perspective, the requested judgment of one’s own perspective can readily be influenced by the presence of another person’s perspective (an “avatar”). In short, the mere presence of the other person can trigger a computation of what that person is seeing even though one is asked only about how things look from one’s own perspective. In short, errors can be generated by an intrusion into the subject’s cognition of an “irrelevant” character. This is called reply to Vignemont and mercier 296 r EP l Y T O   VIG n EMO n T A nd  ME r CIE r “altercentricity.” And it is found even among very young children. Might this be a problem for simulation theory? Initially Vignemont and Mercier argue that it might. This is because of the alleged “priority” of first‐person attribution over third‐person attribution, which they ascribe to simulation theory. What kind of “priority” are they talking about? I am not certain that I understand their claims and ideas here. But it appears that what they mean by first‐person priority is that appeal to one’s own states in mindreading takes precedence over appeal to others’ states. And it might initially seem that the prevalence of altercentricity is directly in conflict with first‐person priority (and hence simulation theory). If this is what they mean, however, there seems to be a confusion between first‐person “priority” in the sense of the use of introspection to read the output states of one’s own simulation process versus “priority” in the sense of giving precedence to oneself as a target to mindread as opposed to another person. Simulation theory is entirely silent on the latter issue. In this sense, the existence and even prevalence of altercentricity is no threat at all to simulation theory. In the end, Vignemont and Mercier come to the same conclusion. They write: “[A]ltercentric bias is compatible with the simulation theory.” On this I wholly agree – though I was rather surprised to find them drawing this conclusion. In the last section of their paper, Vignemont and Mercier engage in some speculation about the evolutionary origins of altercentricity and altercentric bias. Possible comparisons are offered about the properties of communicative behavior, like speech (and its reception), and non‐communicative behavior, like serving as a cue. There are interesting parallels here with Mercier’s earlier work. But it would be very premature (in several respects) to undertake to discuss this here. Goldman and His Critics, First Edition.

Finding the Body in the Brain From Simulation Theory to Embodied Simulation i Vi T T o ri o Gall ESE 14 1 Introduction I first met Alvin Goldman in the April of 1998 in Tucson, Arizona. I had been invited to give a plenary talk on mirror neurons (MNs) at the second Towards a Science of Consciousness conference. MNs are motor neurons we discovered in macaques’ motor cortex that discharge both when the action is executed and when it is observed being performed by someone else (di Pellegrino et al. 1992; Gallese et al. 1996; Rizzolatti et al. 1996). It was probably the first time that our discovery was presented to a wide multidisciplinary audience. Alvin attended the talk, asked me questions and afterwards invited me for lunch. In front of delicious Mexican food he briefly introduced me to simulation theory (ST), which back then I wasn’t acquainted with. Alvin pointed out the relevance of MNs for ST, as the former could constitute an important sub‐personal component of some form of low‐level simulation. We decided to deepen our discussions and finally agreed upon writing a paper together, which appeared in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences the very same year (Gallese and Goldman 1998). In that paper we concluded that “a ‘cognitive continuity’ exists within the domain of intentional state attribution from non‐human primates to humans, and that MNs represent its neural correlate. This continuity is grounded in the ability of both human and non‐human primates to detect goals in the observed behavior of conspecifics. The capacity to understand action goals, already present in non‐human primates, relies on a process that matches the observed behavior to the action plans of the observer […]. Action‐goal understanding […] constitutes a necessary phylogenetic stage within the evo- lutionary path leading to the fully developed mind‐reading abilities of human beings” (Gallese and Goldman 1998: 500). 298 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN I still think such a statement is valid: the empirical evidence on MNs accumulated during the following two decades has shown that in both macaques and humans MNs indeed do not map just movements, but also goal‐related motor acts. however, after the publication of our 1998 paper I developed the idea that the type of mindreading addressed by ST as conceived by Goldman was perhaps cognitively exceeding the functional prop- erties of MNs. I wanted to provide a simulation type account of mirroring that would not depend on introspection. At the same time, I felt the need to specify a simulation process that could also be applied to other neural phenomena not directly related to mindreading, like the way the cortical motor system maps space around the body, the activation of hand grasping‐related neurons during the observation of manipulable objects (canonical neu- rons) (see Murata et al. 1997; Raos et al. 2006), and the relationship between the activation of the cortical motor system and the understanding of action‐related language. Thus, I introduced the notion of embodied simulation (eS) (Gallese 2003a, 2003b, 2005a, 2005b). In the present chapter I review these issues and clarify some aspects of eS. In particu- lar, I discuss the notion of simulation as reuse. I will conclude by introducing some recent developments of eS in relation to language, proposing that eS instantiates a form of paradigmatic knowledge. Before moving to eS we must first address how cognitive neu- roscience revolutionized our knowledge on the cortical motor system, by introducing the notion of motor cognition. 2 Motor Cognition For decades the main goal of the neurophysiological investigation of the cortical motor system was uniquely focused on the study of elementary physical features of movement such as force, direction, and amplitude. however, a series of empirical results shows that the cortical motor system plays an important role in cognition. In particular, the neuro- physiological study of the ventral premotor cortex and the posterior parietal cortex of macaque monkeys demonstrated that the cortical motor system is functionally organized in terms of motor goals. Many cortical motor neurons do not discharge during the execu- tion of elementary movements, but are active before and during motor acts – movements executed to accomplish a specific motor outcome – such as grasping, tearing, holding or manipulating objects. These motor neurons map the relationship, in motor terms, between the agent and the object of the motor act. F5 neurons indeed become active only if a par- ticular type of effector‐object relation (for example, hand‐object) is executed until the relation leads to a different motor outcome (for example, to take possession of a piece of food, to throw it away, to break it, to bring it to the mouth, etc.) regardless of the effector employed, (see Rizzolatti et al. 2000), or of the movements the effector employs to grasp the object (Umiltà et al. 2008). A further element of novelty about the cognitive properties of the cortical motor system concerns its role in perception, since we now know that many motor neurons are endowed with sensory properties. Several studies consistently showed that premotor and parietal areas contain neurons that perceptually respond to visual, auditory and soma- tosensory inputs (see Rizzolatti and Gallese 1997; Fogassi et al. 1996; Rizzolatti et al. 2000). F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 299 Altogether, these findings led to the formulation of the “Motor Cognition” hypothesis as a leading element for the emergence of social cognition (see Gallese et  al. 2009). According to this hypothesis, cognitive abilities like the mapping of space and its per- ception, the perception of objects occupying our visual landscape, the hierarchical representation of action with respect to a distal goal, the detection of motor goals and action anticipation are possible because of the peculiar functional architecture of the motor system, organized in terms of goal‐directed motor acts. The proper develop- ment of such functional architecture likely scaffolds more cognitively sophisticated social cognitive abilities. Whenever we look around, we are somehow aware of what is reachable and what is not. We can anticipate whether a falling object may hit us or not. We can calibrate the move- ment in space of our hand so as to be able to catch a fly. We can identify objects, and locations in space where sounds may come from with a remarkable precision. All of these perceptual qualities are not the outcome of the impression exerted by the external world on our perceptual and cognitive systems. Cognitive neuroscience tells us a different story. These perceptual qualities are the intentional correlates of the motor potentialities expressed by our situated body. A peculiar example comes from the relationship between motor potentialities and spa- tial mapping, exemplified by macaque monkeys’ ventral premotor area F4 (Matelli et al. 1985), part of a parieto‐premotor cortical network mapping specific sensory events in the space near the body onto the neural representation of arm and head motor acts (Rizzolatti and Luppino 2001). F4 neurons not only control orienting/avoidance movements of the head and reaching movements of the upper limb, they also respond to tactile stimuli applied to the same body parts whose movements they control, and to visual and auditory stimuli, provided they occur within monkey’s peripersonal space. F4 neurons’ visual and auditory receptive fields (RFs) are body‐centered, that is, they are anchored to body parts and move along with them. Thus, perceiving a visual object or hearing a sound within peripersonal space evokes the motor simulation of the most appropriate actions towards that very same spatial location (Rizzolatti et al. 1997; Gallese 2005b). Most interestingly, a putative human homologue of monkey area F4 was identified in the premotor cortex. Bremmer et  al. (2001) demonstrated that the ventral region of human premotor cortex responds to tactile stimuli applied to the face and to visual and auditory stimuli presented within its peripersonal space. Furthermore, repetitive tran- scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over premotor cortex interferes with the processing of multisensory stimuli within the hand’s peripersonal space (Serino et al. 2011). These results show that the cortical motor system both in non‐human primates and humans maps the body’s motor potentialities and that such mapping enables the multisensory integration of self bodily‐related stimuli affecting the body and its surrounding space. Another instantiation of motor cognition comes from canonical neurons. They discharge both during hand grasping of objects and their observation in absence of any detectable movement of the monkey (see Jeannerod et al. 1995; Murata et al. 1997; Rizzolatti et al. 2001; Raos et al. 2006; Umiltà et al. 2007). Very often, a strict congruence has been observed between the type of grip controlled by a given neuron and the size or shape of the object effective in triggering its “visual” response. In a considerable percentage of neurons a 300 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN congruence is observed between the response during the execution of a specific type of grip, and the visual response to objects that, although differing in shape, nevertheless all afford the same type of grip (see Murata et al. 1997; Raos et al. 2006). Thus, the very same neuron controlling a hand prehension suitable to grasp small objects will also fire equally well to the mere visual presentation of small objects like a small sphere, a small cone or a small cube. The objects shapes are different but they all specify a similar type of grasping. The function of F5 canonical grasping neurons can hardly be defined in purely sensory or motor terms alone. Within the cortical motor system, objects are processed in motor relationally‐specified terms (Gallese 2000). According to the logic of such neural network, a series of physical entities, 3d objects, are identified, differentiated, and represented not in relation to their mere visual appearance, but in relation to the effect of the potential interaction with a situated potentially acting agent. This prop- erty qualifies as an intentional type of representation, although still fully within the functional architecture of the cortical motor system. The first conclusion we can draw is that canonical neurons contribute to a multimodal representation of individual‐ object‐relations. The visual world is always also the horizon of our potential pragmatic relation to it (Gallese and Sinigaglia 2010). What is remarkable here is the fact that the functionality of the motor system literally carves out a pragmatic Umwelt, dynamically surrounding our body. The profile of perip- ersonal space is not arbitrary: it maps and delimits a perceptual space expressing – and being constituted by – the motor potentialities of the body parts it surrounds. Manipulable objects, like the coffee mug sitting on my desk, are not only 3d shapes, visual forms with a given size, orientation, color, texture, and contrast. The coffee mug I am looking at now is the potential target of my intentional action and it is mapped as such by my cortical motor system. I submit that an important component of my perceptual experience of the coffee mug is determined, constrained, and ultimately constituted by the limits imposed by what my body can potentially do with it. This evidence enables one to appreciate how the brain can map intentional actions. Such mapping appears to be more “basic” with respect to the standard propositional account of the representation of action. The intentional character, the “aboutness” of the representational format of our mind could be deeply rooted in the intrinsic relational character of the bodily format of bodily action representation. This, in turn, shows how intrinsically intertwined action, perception, and cognition are (hurley 1998; see also Gallese 2000). Content is not exhausted by the propositional format of representation. Representational content cannot be fully explained without considering the ongoing modeling process of organisms as currently integrated with the object to be represented, by intending it. This integration process between the representing organism and the represented object is articulated in multiple fashions, for example, by intending to explore it by moving the eyes, by walking towards it, by intending to hold it in the focus of attention, by intending to grasp it, and ultimately, by thinking about it (see Gallese 2000; Gallese and Metzinger 2003). The same motor circuits that control the ongoing behavior of individuals within their environment also map distances, locations and objects in that very same environment, F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 301 thus defining and shaping in motor terms their representational content. The way the visual world is represented by the motor system incorporates agents’ idiosyncratic way to interact with it. To put it simply, the producer and repository of representational content is not the brain per se, but the brain‐body system, by means of its interactions with the world of which it is part. I think these aspects already in themselves justify the necessity to define a functional process, neither confined to mindreading, nor committed to a propositional representa- tional format. eS is meant to be this sort of functional mechanism. 3 Mirroring Mechanisms The empirical investigation of the neural basis of social cognition has been one of the most important targets of cognitive neuroscience during the last two decades. This research has repeatedly shown that a series of cortical regions (for example, mesial frontal areas, the temporo‐parietal junction, etc.) are activated during explicit mentalizing tasks (for review, see Frith and Frith 2010). Unfortunately, most of these studies do not go beyond a mere correlational enterprise. The truth is that we do not know why these corti- cal areas are relevant to mindreading; unless we content ourselves with the tautological statement that mindreading is implemented in those brain areas. Two further problems of this approach are the reification of mental notions like intention, desire, and belief into things to be found at specific brain locations, and the questionable mindreading specificity underlying the activation of the same brain regions. A possible way out of this impasse may stem from a comparative perspective on social cognition, enabling the study of the neurophysiological mechanisms implicated in basic aspects of social cognition in non‐human primates like macaque monkeys (Gallese 2007; see also Gallese 2014; Ammaniti and Gallese 2014). As will be shown in this chapter, the investigation of the functional properties of the cortical motor system of macaques turned out to be quite fruitful. The discovery in the early 1990s of MNs in the brain of macaques (Gallese et al. 1996; Rizzolatti et al. 1996), and the subsequent discovery of mirror mechanisms (MMs) in the human brain (see Gallese et al. 2004; Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia 2010) demonstrate that a direct modality of access to the meaning of others’ behavior is available, a modality that is different from the explicit attribution of propositional attitudes. MNs are motor neurons that not only respond to the execution of movements and actions, but also during their perception when executed by others. The relational character of behavior as mapped by the cortical motor system enables the appreciation of purpose without relying on explicit propositional inference. The relation between actions and their outcomes was traditionally assumed to be largely independent of the motor processes and representations underpinning action execution. Such processes and representations would concern elementary motor features, such as joint displacements or muscle contractions. however, empirical evidence chal- lenges this view. We have seen that motor processes may involve motor representations of action outcomes (for example, to grasp, to place, etc.), and not only kinematic or dynamic 302 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN components of actions. This suggests that beliefs, desires, and intentions are neither primitive, nor the only bearers of intentionality in action. We do not necessarily need to meta‐represent in propositional format the motor intentions of others to understand them. Motor outcomes and motor intentions are part of the “vocabulary” spoken by the motor system. In several situations we do not explicitly ascribe intentions to others; we simply detect them. Indeed, I posited that bodily formatted motor representation is enough to ground the directedness of an action to its outcome (Gallese 2000, 2003a, 2003b; see also Butterfill and Sinigaglia 2014). The discovery of MNs gives us a new empirically founded notion of intersubjectivity connoted first and foremost as intercorporeality – the mutual resonance of intentionally meaningful sensorimotor behaviors. The ability to understand others as intentional agents does not exclusively depend on propositional competence, but it is in the first place dependent on the relational nature of action. According to this hypothesis, it is possible to directly understand others’ basic actions by means of the motor equivalence between what others do and what the observer can do. Intercorporeality thus becomes the primordial source of knowledge that we have of others. The motor simulation instantiated by neurons endowed with “mirror properties” is probably the neural correlate of this human faculty, describable in functional terms as an instantiation of eS (Gallese 2003a, 2005a, 2011; Gallese and Sinigaglia 2011). Action constitutes only one dimension of the rich baggage of experiences involved in interpersonal relations. every interpersonal relation implies the sharing of a multiplicity of states like, for instance, the experience of emotions and sensations. As originally hypothesized by Goldman and Gallese (2000), empirical research demonstrated that the very same nervous structures involved in the subjective experience of emotions and sensa- tions are also active when such emotions and sensations are recognized in others. A mul- tiplicity of “mirroring” mechanisms are present in our brain. It was proposed that these mechanisms, thanks to the “intentional attunement” they generate (Gallese 2006), allow us to recognize others as our fellows, likely making intersubjective communication and mutual implicit understanding possible. The functional architecture of eS seems to constitute a basic characteristic of our brain, making possible our rich and diversified intersubjective experiences, being at the basis of our capacity to empathize with others. 4 Embodied Simulation and Simulation Theory MNs boosted a renewed interest in simulation theories and also suggested an embodied approach to simulation (Gallese 2003a, 2003b, 2005a, 2005b, 2014). embodied simulation (eS) aimed to account for basic social interactions by means of a neurobiologically plau- sible and theoretically unitary framework. What are the main differences between eS and ST? First of all, as shown above, eS is not confined to mindreading. ST is mainly applied as a fundamental heuristic strategy for mindreading. ST claims that understanding others’ behavior usually involves pretense. People first create in themselves pretend desires, preferences and beliefs of the sort they take others to have. These are then fed into their own decision‐making mechanism, which outputs pretend decisions used to predict F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 303 others’ decisions (see Goldman 2006). Simulation can also be used to retrodict mental states, that is, to identify which mental states led another individual to perform a given action. Gallese and Goldman suggested that MNs’ discharge “serves the purpose of retrodicting the target mental states, moving backwards from the observed action” (Gallese and Goldman 1998: 497), thus representing “a primitive version, or possibly a precursor in phylogeny, of a simulation heuristic that might underlie mindreading” (Gallese and Goldman 1998: 498). Two questions remained open to further developments and discussions: 1) What kind of simulation heuristic is involved in the MM, for there does not seem to be room here for pretense, or for belief and desire attribution? 2) What kind of mindreading is rooted in the MM? eS theory was introduced also to attempt answering both of these questions. Two different views on the core meaning of “mental simulation” are currently being proposed: simulation as resemblance and simulation as reuse. According to the first view, a mental state or process simulates another mental state or process just in case it copies, reproduces, or resembles the second state or process and in doing so performs a function (Goldman 2006; see also Gordon 1986; heal 1986; Goldman 1989; Currie and Ravenscroft 2002). The notion of simulation as resemblance seems to fit the standard story of simula- tion type mindreading. The simulator supposedly forms pretend mental states matching, as closely as possible, initial mental states of the target, and uses her own decision‐making system to generate pretend mental states which match the target’s states as closely as pos- sible (Goldman 2006, 2009). According to the alternative view, simulation as reuse, there is mental simulation just in case the same mental state or process that is used for one purpose is reused for another purpose (hurley 2008; Gallese 2009, 2011, 2014; Gallese and Sinigaglia 2011). The main argument of the reuse view is that, on almost any story, all simulation type mindreading requires any resemblance of the mental states or processes between the simulator and the target to arise from the reuse of the simulator’s own mental states or processes. At bottom it is mental reuse, not resemblance, that drives mindreading (hurley 2008). Let’s look more closely at what the notion of reuse entails. For quite a few years (Gallese 2000) I have been advocating a role for exaptation (Gould and Lewontin 1979) as a key explanatory element of the phylogenesis of human social cognition. exaptation refers to the shift in the course of evolution of a given trait or mechanism, which is later on reused to serve new purposes and functions. According to this view, which I sketched in the pre- ceding sections, intentionality, the aboutness of our representations is  –  in the first place – an exapted property of the action models instantiated by the cortical motor system (see Gallese 2000: 34). The motor system not only houses causative properties but also content properties. I subsequently introduced the notions of “neural exploitation” and “neural reuse” (Gallese and Lakoff 2005; Gallese 2008) to refer to the newly acquired commitment of sensorimotor neural resources to language and conceptual thought. Sensorimotor systems, originally evolved to guide our interactions with the world, once decoupled from the common final motor pathway and dynamically reconnected with other cortical areas – as, among others, the prefrontal regions of the brain, can be put into the service of newly acquired cognitive skills. 304 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN This perspective is gaining growing consensus as epitomized by dehaene’s “neuronal recycling” hypothesis (2005), or by Anderson’s hypothesis on “neural reuse” (2010). The “neuronal recycling” hypothesis was prompted by the discovery of a cortical visual area in the human occipito‐temporal region (the visual word form area, VWFA) specifically activated by early perceptual stages of the reading process. Such specificity is clearly reading‐dependent, as it doesn’t show up in individuals who never learned to read. In these individuals VWFA is activated by other non‐language‐related visual stimuli. Since reading and writing are very late cognitive acquisitions of our species, VWFA specificity for reading cannot be genetically predetermined, but it rather exemplifies an instantiation of reuse or “recycling.” This notion of reuse holds that a given brain area’s neural specialization for processing a certain type of sensory stimuli can also instantiate a novel use‐dependent functional specialization for different stimuli of the same sensory modality. Such hypothesis does not make any strong evolutionary claim, as reuse is basically conceived of only at the ontoge- netic level. Novel cultural habits, like writing and reading, have the potentiality to remodel in a use‐dependent way a given regional brain function in the course of one individual’s life by amplifying the set of stimuli belonging to the same sensory domain it can process. I applied the notion of neural reuse in relation to the MM and eS as a general principle of brain function. I applied it to social cognition in general, and to language and concep- tual thought in particular (Gallese and Lakoff 2005; Gallese 2008). According to Anderson’s (2010) more systematic view, by neural reuse different brain areas participate in different functions through their dynamical engagement with different brain circuits. Furthermore, a given cognitive function can be supported by a variety of brain circuits; the newer in evolutionary terms a cognitive function is, the wider is the brain circuit underpinning it. In contrast to dehaene, both Anderson’s and my hypotheses on neural reuse do make strong evolutionary claims as they deal with the phylogenesis of human cognitive functions, challenging the strict adaptationism heralded by evolutionary psychology. Neural reuse not only enables the cortical motor system to process and integrate perceptual stimuli, hence instantiating novel cognitive functions, but also sheds new light on the phylogenesis and ontogenesis of the vicarious experiences characterizing human intersubjectivity. Which core notion of mental simulation better fits the standard story of mindreading is not at issue here. eS theory does not aim to provide a general notion of mental simula- tion, nor a unitary account of the different stages involved in simulation type mindread- ing. Rather, eS theory aims to explain the MM and related phenomena. eS theory posits that the MM counts as implementing mental simulation processes primarily because brain and cognitive resources typically used for one purpose are reused for another purpose. For instance, the activation of parieto‐premotor cortical networks, which typically serve the purpose of representing and accomplishing a single motor out- come (such as grasping something), or a hierarchy of motor outcomes (such as grasping something for bringing to the mouth or for placing), might also serve the purpose of attributing the same motor goal or motor intention to others. The same holds for emo- tions and sensations. Within the anterior insula the same voxels typically underpinning the subjective experience of disgust also activate when attributing disgust to others. F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 305 This does not imply that one should deny the MM its matching role. Quite the contrary. From the very beginning the MM has been interpreted as a mechanism directly matching the visual or auditory representation of observed actions, emotions or sensa- tions with the observer’s own motor, visceromotor or somatosensory representations of the same actions, emotions, and sensations, respectively. The direct matching, however, is here primarily intrapersonal, since it pertains to the mental states or processes that an individual undergoes both when planning action or experiencing emotions and sensa- tions and when observing someone else’s actions, emotions and sensations. of course, this matching may also allow for interpersonal similarity of mental states or processes, but the latter would be strictly dependent upon the interpersonal sharing of the same neural and cognitive resources (Gallese and Sinigaglia 2011). When such sharing is limited or missing, people are not fully able or are not able at all to match the mental states or pro- cesses of others because they don’t have suitable mental states or processes to reuse. The simulational reuse of mental states and processes instantiated by eS is constitutively embodied. Goldman and de Vignemont (2009) provided a very useful taxonomy of the different notions of embodiment. Accordingly, “embodied” means that body parts, bodily actions, or body representations play a crucial role in cognition. Note, however, that body representations might be interpreted in terms of mental representations either with a bodily content (representations of the body), or with a bodily format. eS theory makes use of a notion of embodiment according to which mental states or processes are embodied because of their bodily format. The crucial notion here is that mental representations might differ in virtue not only of their content but also of their format. Just as a map and a series of sentences might represent the same route with a different format, so mental representations might have partly overlapping contents (for example, an action outcome) while differing from one another in their format (for exam- ple, bodily instead of propositional). The bodily format of a mental representation constrains what such mental representa- tion can represent, because of the bodily constraints posed by the specific configuration of the human body. We have seen how this applies to space, objects, and others’ behaviors and experiences. A core claim of eS theory is that similar constraints apply both to the repre- sentations of one’s own actions, emotions or sensations involved in actually acting and experiencing and also to the corresponding representations involved in observing someone else performing a given action or experiencing a given emotion or sensation. These con- straints are similar because the representations have a common bodily format. hence, eS is the reuse of mental states and processes involving representations that have a bodily format. The nature and the range of what can be achieved with eS are constrained by the bodily format of the representations involved. It should be added that while eS as reuse is fully consistent with the B‐format theory put forward by Goldman and de Vignemont (2009), this doesn’t necessarily imply that all forms of embodied cognition should be based on reuse. Indeed, the firing of a neuron or group of neurons in a premotor area as part of a plan of action or a motor command would certainly qualify as an instantiation of embod- ied cognition according to the B‐format approach, but it wouldn’t be an instance of reuse. The bodily format also determines how eS contributes to mindreading. The term “mindreading” is almost universally employed to refer to the human ability to understand 306 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN others’ expressive behavior and the causes and reasons producing it. In spite of using this term, I don’t commit myself to the notion that understanding others just consists of literally “reading their minds.” I suspect that the term mindreading might qualify differ- ent types of epistemic approaches to the other. My proposal is to consider mindreading, as conceived of in a broad sense, as a non meta‐representational way of understanding others, basically sharing a common crucial feature: the mapping of the other onto the self, reciprocated by the mapping of the self on the other. This approach to intersubjectivity qualifies as second‐person perspective (see Gallese 2014). Mindreading as conceived of in a narrow sense, should instead qualify the type of explicit third‐person form of understanding we refer to when others’ behaviors or mental states are opaque and ambiguous, thus requiring explanations. Unfortunately, the classic approach to mindreading is to date unable to convincingly explain why a series of brain areas like medial frontal areas and the temporo‐parietal junction systematically activate during explicit mentalizing tasks, besides claiming that mindreading happens to be located there (for a detailed discussion of this point, see Ammaniti and Gallese 2014: 3–6). I posited that eS and the underpinning MMs by means of neural reuse can constitu- tively account for the representation of the motor goals of others’ actions by reusing one’s own bodily formatted motor representations, as well as of others’ emotions and sensations by reusing one’s own visceromotor and sensorimotor representations. eS can provide a unified explanatory framework for mindreading as conceived of in the broad sense speci- fied above. our bodily acting and sensing nature appears to constitute the real transcen- dental basis upon which our experience of the social world is built. A further element of convergence with Alvin Goldman consists in how eS is able to attribute to others its contents. Basically, there are two ways in which a given mental content can be attributed to others: the first one is explicit and representational, while the second one is implicit and functional. It has been proposed that eS makes it possible to functionally attribute mental processes and contents to others (Gallese and Sinigaglia 2011). once the attribution process is spelled out in functional terms, I guess Alvin Goldman would concede that eS could constitutively support “mindreading in the broad sense,” as defined above. Last but not least, I share with Alvin Goldman the idea that we can’t renounce the notion of representation, provided it comes in different formats, like the bodily one. If this equates to a “moderate approach to embodied cognitive science” (see Goldman 2012), then my approach is moderate too. Understanding others is a complex enterprise. It requires the representation of others’ proximal and distal goals, others’ emotional state, the identification of the beliefs, desires, and intentions specifying the reasons promoting behavior, and the understanding of how those reasons are linked to agents and to their behavior. 5 Body and Language: Facts and Challenges one of the key challenges for the embodied approach to human social cognition con- sists in understanding whether and how our bodily nature determines some of the key aspects identifying the uniqueness of human language. Are linguistic activities like F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 307 denying, asking or doubting anchored to bodily mechanisms? The question is open and empirical research must address this challenge in the coming years. In the meantime, at least at a purely speculative level, let us try to delineate a possible point of contact between the anthropogenic power of language and eS. There is indeed a way to connect the common pre‐linguistic sphere to the linguistic one (Gallese 2003b, 2007, 2008; Gallese and Lakoff 2005; Glenberg and Gallese 2011). It consists in showing that language, when it refers to the body in action, brings into play the neural resources normally used to move that very same body. Seeing someone performing an action, like grabbing an object, and listening to or reading the linguistic description of that action leads to a similar motor simulation that activates some of the same regions of our cortical motor system, including those with mirror properties, normally activated when we do perform that action. These data on the role of eS in understanding language broadly confirm the thesis according to which the bodily, sensory, and motor dimensions play a constitutive role in language production and understanding. however, it seems that the relationship between language and body does not move along a single direction. The fact is that language is unequivocally constitutive of human nature and, as such, seems to offer us wholly human modalities of experiencing our corporeity. In this sense, neuroscientific data on the role of eS during understanding of language also point to a complementary reading with respect to the one previously proposed. on the one hand, eS might play a crucial role in understanding language. Indeed, if one reversibly interferes with this process, for instance by means of transcranial‐TMS stimu- lation, understanding of language is jeopardized. on the other hand, language allows us, and this is unique among all living species, to fix and relive specific aspects of our bodily experience. Through language we can crystallize and relive fragments of experiences that are not topical, that is to say are not my experiences now, but become a paradigm, a model, for understanding others and us. In the following section I briefly discuss the role of eS seen as a paradigm or model in the light of the Aristotelian notion of paradeigma.ii The possibility of hypostatizing and then reliving segments of our experiences independently of the immediate physical context, or independently of specific physical stimuli, is a possibility that only the pos- session of language allows us to experience. The faculty of language is therefore, on one side, rooted in corporeity but, in turn, it changes and shapes our way of living bodily experiences. 6 Social Cognition, Body and Language: Es as a Paradigm? The relation between body and language was to a great extent underestimated in the last century, thanks, above all, to Chomsky’s major influence. In 1966 Chomsky published a book significantly entitled Cartesian Linguistics. It is from descartes that the idea comes that language has little to do with the body. The Cartesian thesis on the relationship between language and body implies, on one side, that the body is not a substratum and material of language and, on the other, that language is exclusively the tool to express a 308 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN thought that is formed independently of language itself. According to descartes and the Cartesian tradition of which Chomsky too is part, language is the tool through which we manifest an autonomous thought preceding language – a thought structured by logic but certainly not by language, whose role is circumscribed and downsized to that of being a mere label of thoughts (cf. hinzen and Sheehan 2013 for a critical discussion of the issue). The theses informing the Cartesian idea of language can today be challenged. Language makes meaning general, releasing it from the context, that is, from the dimensions of who, what, how, where, and when. Language provides us with a unique modality of reference to the world, allowing us at the same time to transcend contingent determinations and to define them at a different level, thanks to the use of concepts like subject, object, time, space, universal, etc. Such concepts correspond to precise grammatical structures that, most likely, contributed by co‐evolutionary dynamics to the structuring of rational thought (hinzen and Sheehan 2013). Thanks to language we can speak of mankind without referring in particular to any of the single individuals sharing the property of belonging to the human species. We can speak of a subject aside from the individual embodiments of this attribute, etc. Language provides us with general meaning, valid for everybody but, at the same time, being nobody’s meaning. Interestingly enough, according to Giorgio Agamben (2008) what holds “for every- body and nobody” is referable to the Greek notion of paradeigma, originally explored by Aristotle. The paradeigma is a type of argumentation that moves between individual and individual according to a form of bipolar analogical knowledge. Agamben (2008: 23–4), radicalizing Aristotle’s theses, maintains that the paradigm can only be conceived of by abandoning the dichotomy between individual and universal: the rule does not exist before the single cases to which it is applied. The rule is nothing but its own exhibition in the single cases themselves, which thus it renders intelligible. By applying the notion of paradigm to the grammatical “rules” of language, Agamben highlights a central point: the linguistic rule derives from the suspension of the concrete denotative application: “That is to say, in order to be able to serve as an example, the syntagm must be suspended from its normal function, and, nevertheless, it is precisely through this non‐operation and this suspension that it can show how the syntagm works, can allow the formulation of the rule” (2008: 26). According to Agamben, “…in the para- digm, intelligibility does not precede the phenomenon, but is, so to speak, ‘alongside’ it (parà)” (2008: 29). In other words “…in the paradigm there is not an origin or an arché: every phenomenon is the origin, every image is archaic” (2008: 33). In Agamben’s reading, the Aristotelian paradeigma is a good model to describe the creation of linguistic rules. Starting from Agamben’s intuition and seeking to move one step further, the hypothesis that we want to explore here is that the notion of paradeigma is a good model not only for the creation of linguistic rules but also for the definition of the embodied simulation mechanism. In this connection, simulation allows us, at a senso- rimotor level, to hypostatize and reuse what holds “for everybody and nobody.” To understand to what extent the analogy between eS and paradeigma is plausible it is necessary to go back to Aristotle (2012). What is meant by paradeigma in Aristotelian thought and in what context does Aristotle make use of this notion? The paradeigma is a F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 309 typical form of rhetorical reasoning, which Aristotle discusses both in Prior Analytics and in Rhetoric. Argumentation based on the paradeigma, for example, consists in the presen- tation by the orator of an exemplary case, based on a historical fact or a figment of the imagination, as in the case of fables. It is the juxtaposition of the present situation and the exemplary one that guides, or should guide, the actions of the person to whom the argu- mentation is addressed. Thus the paradeigma, among rhetorical argumentations, is that which goes from the particular to the particular, from an exemplary case to the present situation. Argumentation based on the paradeigma does not claim universality. The orator is not bound to offer an exhaustive number of cases justifying a universally valid conclu- sion. one case is sufficient, provided that it is particularly suitable, precisely exemplary, in relation to the context in which the argumentative discourse takes place. A distinguishing feature of the paradeigma consists in always proceeding from what is “best known and first for us” (Aristotle and Ross, 1978, II.19), or from what is for us most immediate and most easily accessible, because being part of our baggage of experiences and knowledge. At a different level of analysis, this feature also characterizes eS. The condition for the simulation mechanism to be enacted is sharing a baggage of (motor) experiences and knowledge. eS is enacted starting from what for us is “first,” that is, what for us is known and easily accessible in terms of motor potentialities and experiences. Sharing a repertoire of practices, experiences, and sensations is therefore an essential condition, since only by starting from what is well known to us it is possible to identify analogies between our actions and those of others. We understand the other starting from our own bodily experience, which is what is “best known and first for us,” again using Aristotle’s words. on the basis of this knowledge we identify similar elements in our expe- riences and as well as in those of others. eS, when manifested in the phenomenon of action, emotion or sensation mirroring, always involves an original I–Thou relationship in which the “Thou” is the term with respect to which the self is constituted. on the other hand, the “self ” is the basis on which immediate and implicit understanding of the “Thou” is possible. The analogy with the cognitive mechanism subtended by paradigmatic reasoning appears evident. Indeed, in the case of Aristotle’s paradeigma, an example, a particular case, is understood because it is close to our feeling, our experiences, our baggage of knowledge. And the process does not stop here. This form of understanding of a particular that is not I will lead me to new conclusions and to a deeper understanding of myself, of my particular case and of my situation. our experiences are therefore the measure from which we understand others and their experiences. And others’ experiences are for us a condition for a deeper under- standing of ourselves. Thus, the eS underpinning my experience is also a paradeigma from which I can understand what I observe in others and draw inferences from it for others and for myself. The embodied simulation mechanism, thus defined, is constitutive of the process of construction of meaning. In this connection, eS enacted while understanding language is not my present experience but the paradeigma in relation to which some of our linguistic expressions acquire a meaning that is rooted in the body. When we read or listen to the description of an action, the process of simulation taking place in us is not the enactment of the same action; we would be echopractic if we were unable to avoid imitating and 310 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN reproducing all the actions that we see or whose description we listen to or read. According to the present hypothesis, instead, eS makes available to us an exemplary case, a model, in relation to which understanding of language is also enacted. If therefore it is true that the symbolic dimension opens up some possibilities for us and creates worlds for us which only linguistic creatures can enter, on the other hand it is also true that language strongly exploits mechanisms rooted in our corporeality. enactment of the simulation process in understanding language seems to suggest that the symbolic dimension and the bodily one cohabit in linguistic praxis. Nevertheless, the nature of this relationship is still not entirely clear, nor are the con- fines clear between the bodily dimension and the typically or exclusively symbolic one. Can it be hypothesized that corporeal knowledge also plays a role in understanding logical operators like, for instance, negation or disjunction, or that it plays a role in understand- ing the interrogative form? The whole symbolic nature of these linguistic structures appears in some respects beyond question. Research on these issues is now open and today many wonder about the possibility of identifying mechanisms that can anchor such structures to our bodily experience. This is the real challenge for the embodied cognition approach to the role played by language in human social cognition. Let us once more return to the Aristotelian notion of paradeigma and appraise other possible hints for substantiating the analogy with the embodied simulation mechanism. The understanding that the rhetor calls for through reasoning based on the paradeigma should lead the citizen to choose what is best for him in various circumstances. The goal of such reasoning is to determine understanding of a present situation, by analogy with a historical example or a fable, and, on the basis of this more informed knowledge, to guide man’s choices. In other words, that of the rhetorical example/paradeigma is knowledge whose main goal is practical and not theoretical. A practical aim also characterizes embodied simulation. embodied simulation is always aimed at “navigating” in the world and, therefore, eventually at acting. It was hypothe- sized that embodied simulation allows us a direct, experiential form of understanding of other people’s actions and experiences and, on the basis of this understanding, it allows us to regulate our actions and our experiences. These goals are always practical. In some respects, the process of embodied simulation that is enacted, for instance, when reading a novel (see Wojciehowski and Gallese 2011), also has a practical aim. Literature recreates a world of emotions and experiences, the emotions and the experiences of the literary char- acters inhabiting the fictional world of the novel. The simulation mechanism helps us to “navigate” in that world, even if it is a fictitious world; it allows us to understand and, partly, to relive the emotions of the protagonists and their vicissitudes. The aim in this case is practical insofar as the simulation mechanism allows us to approach the other with a second‐person epistemic perspective (Gallese 2014). eS makes implicit knowledge about others immediately available, with the aim of regulating our interactions with them. For example, our understanding of literary char- acters is almost always second‐person, based on the possibility of perceiving analogies between our own experiences and others’ and made possible by the hypostatization of our experiences that is achieved through the simulation mechanism (Wojciehowski and Gallese 2011). F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN 311 In conclusion, what is eS if not suspension of the “concrete” application of a process? Let us think of when MNs are activated in observing actions performed by others; or of when canonical neurons are activated while we are looking at the keyboard of a computer thinking about what we want to write; or when cortical motor neurons are activated when we imagine ourselves writing on that keyboard. These responses of motor neurons manifest the activa- tion of implicit knowledge, bodily motor knowledge expressing the motor potentialities of the bodily self mapped by the motor system in terms of their motor outcomes. Reuse of motor knowledge, in the absence of the movement that realizes it as exempli- fied by eS is an example of “paradigmatic knowledge.” Thus, eS is a case of implicit paradigmatic knowledge. According to the present hypothesis eS allows us to naturalize the notion of paradigm, anchoring it at a level of sub‐personal description, whose neural correlates we can study. our openness to the world is constituted and made possible by a motor system predis- posing and allowing us to adapt our daily and contingent pragmatic relationships with the world against the background of a prefigured but highly flexible plan of motor intention- ality. Such a plan provides its coordination to any single contingent modality of relation with the world, in which it continues to actualize itself. This aspect is important because it shows that functional processes not specific to humans, like eS, scaffold specific aspects of human social cognition. 7 Conclusions In this chapter I addressed and discussed the notion of eS, trying to show that a new understanding of intersubjectivity can benefit from a bottom‐up study and characteriza- tion of the nonpropositional and non meta‐representational aspects of social cognition (see Gallese 2003a, 2007). I also proposed that eS seems to be able to naturalize the notion of paradigm, natural- izing one of the processes making language reflexivity possible, and thus contributing to “create” the human. Being a subject entails being a body that learns to express itself and to express its world thanks to the paradigm – eS – that allows one to go beyond the body while remaining anchored to it. one key issue of the new approach to intersubjectivity proposed here is the investiga- tion of the neural bases of our capacity to be attuned to the intentional relations of others. At a basic level, our interpersonal interactions do not make explicit use of propositional attitudes. This basic level consists of eS enabling the constitution of a shared meaningful interpersonal space. The shared intersubjective space in which we live from birth consti- tutes a substantial part of our semantic space. Self and other relate to each other because are opposite extensions of the same correlative and reversible we‐centric space (Gallese 2003a). observer and observed are part of a dynamic system governed by reversible rules. By means of intentional attunement, “the other” is much more than a different represen- tational system; it becomes a bodily self, like us. The specific use of cognitive neuroscience here proposed leads to a new take on social cognition. This new take brings about the demonstration on empirical ground of the 312 F IN d ING T he Bod y IN T he B RAIN constitutive role played in foundational aspects of social cognition by the human body, when conceived of in terms of its motor potentialities. Needless to say, this only covers a partial aspect of social cognition. however, eS also provides an epistemological model, potentially useful for the empirical investigation of the more cognitively sophisticated aspects of human social cognition. This new epistemological approach to social cognition has the merit of generating predictions about the intrinsic functional nature of our social cognitive operations, cutting across, and not being subordinated to a specific mind ontol- ogy, like that purported by the classic cognitivist approach. I am not sure whether or how much Alvin Goldman would agree with this hypothesis. What is certain is that I would have never been able to formulate it if I hadn’t been so much influenced and inspired from Goldman’s fundamental philosophical contribution to our understanding of human social cognition.

Vittorio Gallese recounts our meeting at a conference in 1998, where he was spreading the word about mirror neurons to a large audience that had never heard of them. Mirror neurons were discovered in Parma, Italy, by a team led by Giacomo Rizzolatti, of which Gallese is a very prominent part. When I listened to his lecture, the description of mirror neurons immediately resonated with work that I and other philosophers had done on the simulation theory of mindreading. The Parma neuroscientists had not heard of the simulation theory. But it didn’t take much for me to convince Gallese of a possible relationship, or at least homology. Together we published a paper in Trends in Cognitive Sciences that same year. It proved to be an opportune time to approach social cognition through the lens of neuroscience, surprisingly, motor neuroscience. In imme- diately succeeding years there was a great boom of activity provisionally linking mirroring to various aspects of social cognition. V.S. Ramachandran, a noted psychologist, predicted that mirror neurons would do for psychology what dNA did for biology. The paper that Gallese and I published in 1998, alongside a paper by Rizzolatti and Michael Arbib, became two of the most highly cited papers in all of psychology and neuroscience in the last decade and a half, according to Gregory hickok (2014: 23) (himself a critic of the mirror neuron literature). This was all rather astonishing for me, who entered the scene with virtually zero background in neuroscience, although I immediately learned a great deal from the Parma crowd and other scientists, as well as neuroscientifically oriented philosophers. especially helpful were Vittorio and Giacomo Rizzolatti, as well as (in France) Pierre Jacob, Frederique de Vignemont, and Marc Jeannerod. The current status of mirroring is up for debate. Skeptics abound, but their lines of criticism are often rather fuzzy. To judge by its title, The Myth of Mirror Neurons, hickok’s book implies that mirror neurons are a fiction. But the text asserts no such thing; it freely reply to Gallese 316 Re PL y T o G ALL e S e admits their existence. his real claim is that their contribution and importance have been overrated. Probably so; but what else is new? Given space limits, I cannot dive into the territory of mirroring and mindreading. Instead I focus on another topic Gallese introduces: embodied cognition. We haven’t collaborated on this topic, but our views have substantial convergence. The field of embodied cognition is plagued by the fact that every contributor to it means something different by it, and usually doesn’t explain their meaning clearly. I try to be clearer. Also I dissociate myself from conceptions of embodiment that deliberately aim to offer a radical departure from classical cognitivism. Classical artificial intelligence and cognitive science follow descartes in regarding intelligence as higher‐order reason and language, phenomena quite distinct from lower‐level bodily phenomena. Theorists like Rodney Brooks urge us to view intelligence as a bottom‐up phenomenon, grounded in infra‐human systems built for coping (practically) with the environment. This echoes the perspective of Merleau‐Ponty who contended that even higher‐order intelligence is controlled by “the acting body itself,” by an “I can,” not an “I think that.” Analogously, J. J. Gibson offered an account of perception free of “representations,” in contrast with classical cognitivism, in which representations are central. My approach makes ample room for representations, and seeks no radical overthrow of classical cognitivism. Indeed, my approach to embodiment (originally introduced in Goldman and Vignemont 2009) focuses not on the body per se but on its representations. The brain is full of representations of bodily matters (one’s own body specifically), or coded in body‐related‐ or bodily‐derived terms. This much is not new. What is new and newsworthy is the dis- covery that many cognitive activities with no evident relationship with one’s own body are built upon, or derive from, (own) body‐linked representations. I make no claim that all (mental) representation is in body‐related terms, but claim that there is much more such body‐related representation than classical cognitivism acknowledges. Goldman (2012) explains the matter in terms of bodily codes or formats. Cognition C is a specimen of embodied cognition if and only if C uses some member of a special class of codes or formats for representing and/or processing its content, viz., a body‐related code or format (B‐format). Many codes in the mind/brain represent states of the subject’s own body (from an internal perspective). Proprioception and kinaesthesis give the brain information about one’s muscles, joints, and limb positions. Codes associated with activation of the somatosensory cortex and the motor cortex are used to represent conditions of the bodily surface and to send commands to bodily effectors (respectively). These are universally acknowledged types of body‐oriented representations. The intriguing things are new findings that reveal derivative uses of such representations to perform cognitive tasks distinct from the (original) body‐oriented tasks. They reuse bodily‐related representations to represent other matters. This is what fuels interest, in various parts of cognitive science, in the embodied cognition “movement.” here is an example drawn from the mirroring domain (by no means the only source of embodiment phenomena). Although the brain initially uses certain circuits to represent one’s own current emotion states such as fear, disgust, or anger, it also reuses those circuits to represent the same states in other people (Goldman and Sripada 2005; Goldman 2013). Such cases of derivative bodily representation greatly expand the class of what qualifies, under my definition, as “bodily cognitions.” The plausibility of this approach receives theoretical backing from approaches to neural architecture that fly under the label of “massive redeployment hypothesis” or “neural reuse,” as developed by Gallese, Michael Anderson (2010), and others.

Chaz F I r ES t o n E 15 1 Introduction What does it take for a cognitive process to be embodied? In a series of recent articles, Alvin Goldman has laid out a new and unifying approach to this question, centered on a refreshingly straightforward account of when cognition is and isn’t embodied. On this so‐called “moderate approach” to embodiment (Goldman 2012, 2013; Goldman and de Vignemont 2009), a cognitive process is embodied if and only if it recruits a body‐representing system or “bodily format” in executing a cognitive task – even (or especially) when that system has been exapted or “redeployed” from its original purpose for use elsewhere in the mind. For example, if, as some experimental results suggest, understanding action verbs (such as, “kick”) exploits the motoric codes usu- ally used for one’s own actions (for example, the motor commands for kicking), then language comprehension of this sort is embodied. Embodied approaches to cognition have touched all corners of the mind, including higher‐level judgmental processes such as social evaluation (Williams and Bargh 2008; IJzerman and Semin 2010), moral reasoning (Zhong and Liljenquist 2006), and theory of mind (Goldman and de Vignemont 2009; Gallese and Sinigaglia 2011). However, a pri- mary case study across the various discussions of the moderate approach has been the possibility that embodied influences reach all the way down to visual perception. For exam- ple, it has been reported that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills look steeper (Bhalla and Proffitt 1999) and that grasping a baton makes reachable objects look closer (Witt et al. 2005). Building on the prevailing account of these results (Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013), Goldman interprets these findings as paradigm cases of his moderate notion of E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 319 embodiment, taking this work to suggest that bodily formats are recruited in the visual perception of space, such that spatial extents in the world are perceived relative to – or are “scaled by” – our ability to act over them. In framing the case for embodiment in percep- tion, Goldman’s account is positioned to rewrite the traditional understanding of visual perception – which has so far demanded little consideration of such body‐based factors despite being arguably the most extensively studied, comprehensively modeled, and (so we think) best understood part of the mind. this chapter will be pessimistic about such possible rewriting. After further character- izing and reviewing the evidence for moderately embodied visual perception, I will argue that such evidence does not at all support the moderate approach to embodied cognition, even when the relevant studies and accompanying theories are taken at face value. Even if body‐related factors do influence visual perception – and indeed even if spatial perception is sometimes “body‐scaled” – I will show that the prevailing theories of such body‐based influences understand these effects in ways that exclude them as instances of moderately embodied cognition, because they turn out not to recruit “bodily formats” of the sort envisioned by the moderate approach. However, I’ll further suggest that this result should not be surprising, and may even be embraced by proponents of this approach: by the moderate approach’s own motivating principles, visual perception was a poor candidate for embodiment in the first place. 2 The Moderate Approach to Embodied Cognition At the center of the moderate approach to embodied cognition is the notion of a “bodily format” (or “B‐format” for short). B‐formats are meant to be the proprietary codes used by various body‐representing systems, such as the interoceptive systems that underly the proprioception of limbs and the monitoring of metabolic states, or the motor systems that generate commands for executing bodily actions. For a rough example, consider what distinguishes seeing the position of your arm from internally feeling (that is, proprioceptively perceiving) the position of your arm; though both states represent the position of your arm, the latter does so through a body‐oriented system. Similarly, desiring to move your arm differs in at least one way from actually issuing a motor command to move your arm in that the second case involves an instruc- tion from the motor system, and this instruction is plausibly delivered using a code specific to the motor system. On the moderate approach, any instance of cognition that recruits such body‐representing systems for use in a cognitive task is an instance of embodied cognition.i this account has the consequence that internally sensing the positions of our limbs and executing motor actions are themselves instances of embodied cognition (though per- haps “trivially” so). the more interesting – and more controversial – cases are those said to occur when such body‐representing systems are “exapted” or “redeployed” for other cognitive tasks that might otherwise not have involved the body at all. For example, in the earlier‐mentioned case where motor representations of kicking might be recruited to assist in understanding the word “kick,” the same system that generates motor commands 320 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n for kicking is redeployed to help out with understanding language. In that case, “action concepts may be stored in a motoric code” (Goldman 2012: 76), such that the concept tokened by the word “kick” is that motor instruction I give my legs when I kick. Why should cognition work this way? the primary motivation emphasized by Goldman is that evolutionary pressures favor the reuse of pre‐existing cognitive and neural resources for later‐evolving capacities (see also Anderson 2010). For example, the capacity to understand action verbs evolved much later than the capacity to actually plan and execute such actions, so it stands to reason that conservative evolutionary processes may have engineered the more recently evolved function (in this case, understanding lan- guage) to exploit the resources supporting the evolutionarily earlier function (in this case, executing actions). Indeed, neuroimaging data show that hearing the word “kick,” as opposed to “lick,” more strongly activates the somatotopic areas of primary motor cortex associated with the legs (Pulvermüller et al. 2005), as if such sensorimotor areas contrib- ute to the processing and understanding of the corresponding words. Additionally, meta‐ analyses of fmrI studies show that more recently evolved capacities activate more widely distributed constellations of brain areas than do evolutionarily older capacities (Anderson 2007), perhaps because the more recently evolved capacities are more likely to find, and exapt, useful structures and resources already present in the brain. Goldman’s moderate approach has already been influential in its short life (see, for example, Kriegel 2013; Shapiro 2013), and rightly so. Its core criterion for embodiment is unusually straightforward, and it does not require taking on board ancillary controversial assumptions or worldviews about the mind. It is also much friendlier to the cognitive‐ scientific establishment than more “radical” embodied approaches calling for the whole- sale elimination of mental representations from cognitive science (for example, chemero 2009; Wilson and Golonka 2013); true to its name, the “moderate” approach accepts that the mind is an engine of representation, and instead emphasizes the role of bodily repre- sentations in cognition. despite this, the moderate approach remains richer than more flat‐footed embodied approaches holding simply that bodily states causally influence non‐ bodily cognitive processing (for a review, see Wilson 2002); instead, the moderate approach holds that bodily representations often play constitutive roles in non‐bodily cognition. Finally, in offering a unified picture of embodied cognition, the moderate approach manages to cut across other embodied approaches spanning many cognitive domains, drawing on evidence and theories from psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience, social cognition – and, most relevantly here, visual perception. 2.1 Embodied perception and the “scaling” hypothesis A key contribution of the moderate approach has been to use its conceptual resources to frame the case for embodiment in perception, which has been a relatively neglected domain within the broader philosophical literature on embodiment. recent experimental evidence has suggested that visual perception of the spatial environment can be altered by bodily states, such that wearing a heavy backpack makes hills look steeper (Bhalla and Proffitt 1999), holding one’s arms out to one’s sides makes doorway‐like apertures look narrower (Stefanucci E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 321 and Geuss, 2009), wielding reach‐extending batons makes reachable objects look closer (Witt et al. 2005), and wearing specially modified shoes that make the perceiver taller makes environmental objects look shorter (Stefanucci and Geuss 2010). Individual differences in grip size and arm length also reportedly correlate with size and distance judgments of graspable and reachable objects, such that having larger limbs is associated with smaller spatial estimates (Linkenauger et  al. 2009, 2011). Such findings sail under the flag of “embodied perception” (for reviews, see Proffitt 2006; Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013; Witt 2011). What accounts for these results? the interpretation favored by proponents of embodied perception is that the environment is perceived relative to the body. In particular, the idea is that the body provides perception with a bounty of so‐called “perceptual rulers” with which to measure up the world, such that spatial properties are represented by the visual system in units of these body‐based metrics (see especially Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013; Proffitt 2013). For example, when perceiving the distance of a potentially reachable object, this approach holds that the visual system may represent the object to be at a distance equal to some multiple of the perceiver’s reach; and so if the perceiver’s reach varies (either between individuals, or within one individual before and after an experimental manipulation), then the perceived distance of the object in body‐scaled units will vary accordingly. For instance, if the perceiver’s effective reach is increased by grasping a baton, then the object will appear closer, because it will appear to the observer to be fewer reach‐lengths away. In framing the results this way, the perceptual‐ruler approach draws on earlier founda- tional work on so‐called body‐based “scaling” in visual perception, which similarly holds that the visual system can recover spatial properties such as size and distance in units of some aspect of the perceiver’s body. the most prominent such account describes cases in which visual perception represents the world relative to the perceiver’s height (see, for example, Ooi et al. 2001; Sedgwick 1986; Wraga 1999), such that, for example, shorter observers experience objects in the world as being larger and farther away than taller observers do (for a recent philosophical treatment of these ideas, see Bennett 2011). the underlying principle, which owes its theoretical foundation to J.J. Gibson (1979), is that the “scale” of the visually perceived environment is assigned by reference to the body, and the claim from proponents of embodied perception is that height turns out to be only one of many perceptual rulers furnished by the body. this “scaling” view has been widely adopted by the broader research community working on body‐based influences on perception, and it is the leading theory of such effects (see, for example, cañal‐Bruland et al. 2012; Glenberg et al. 2013; Gray et al. 2014; Kirsch et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2012). 2.2 moderately embodied visual perception? the scaling‐based interpretation of the embodied perception results certainly appears con- genial to the moderate approach to embodied cognition, and it is no doubt the reason that Goldman chose these results as the foundational case study for moderately embodied visual perception. Indeed, Goldman (2012) is clear that what makes these cases instances of mod- erately embodied cognition is not simply the experimental results themselves (viz. that 322 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n grasping a baton makes objects look closer), but rather the theory built to support them (viz. that objects look closer in such circumstances because they are represented relative to the perceiver’s reach). On Goldman’s interpretation of the “scaling” theory, it’s not just that the body causally alters perceptual processing, but rather that bodily representations are redeployed to play constitutive roles in how the visual system represents the world. It is this core claim that I wish to challenge. though previous work has questioned cer- tain aspects of the evidence for embodied perception (for example cooper et  al. 2012; durgin et  al. 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Firestone and Scholl 2014; de Grave et al. 2011; Hutchison and Loomis 2006; Ontiveros et al. 2011; Shaffer and Flint 2011; Shaffer et al. 2013; Woods et al. 2009; for a sustained discussion, see Firestone 2013 and Proffitt 2013, as well as Firestone and Scholl, in press), we will for present purposes simply take this evi- dence at face value. We will assume that there are some circumstances in which modifying a perceiver’s bodily states in turn modifies spatial perception – and even that this occurs by body‐based perceptual “scaling.” Instead, the question will be whether such evidence actu- ally supports the moderate approach to embodied cognition. I will suggest not. 3 Visual Perception is a Poor Candidate for Embodiment Before getting our hands dirtier with the evidence for moderately embodied visual per- ception, it is worth noting more generally that the moderate approach’s own theoretical foundation makes visual perception an awkward choice for embodiment. the deepest motivation given for moderate embodiment in cognition has been that, as new cognitive capacities evolve over time, conservative selective pressures favor the appropriation and exaptation of existing cognitive and neural resources. Perhaps this applies satisfyingly enough to capacities such as theory of mind and spoken language (two examples favored by Goldman 2012, 2013, and Goldman and de Vignemont 2009; see also Goldman 2006), which appeared in our relatively recent evolutionary past.ii But this motivation also seems to predict that, all else equal, more evolutionarily ancient cognitive capacities should be less likely to admit of embodied influences. And in that case, visual perception is surely one of the poorest candidates for embodiment of any capacity in our cognitive repertoire. Whereas spoken language may be only several hundred thousand years old (see, for example, Hauser et al. 2002), our evolutionary ancestors had been seeing for as long as they’d been doing just about anything else. Advanced eyes with image‐forming lenses first developed over half of a billion years ago, and more rudimentary visual capabilities existed even before then (Land and Fernald 1992). Indeed, many paleontologists point to the evolution of such optical devices as a primary driver of the “cambrian explosion” that transformed animal life from mostly worm‐like creatures into the sundry and sophisti- cated forms present in modern phyla (Parker 2011). For vision in particular, then, the story is quite the other way around from how the moderate approach would have it: by its own motivating principles, the moderate approach should have placed vision near the very bottom of its list of cognitive systems likely to be embodied. And if we have been perceiv- ing space longer than we have been grasping objects (Iwaniuk and Whishaw 2000), then it seems backwards to suggest that spatial perception “exapted” the capacity for grasping. E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 323 this larger‐scale consideration is echoed by the more specific neuroscientific data that are often considered suggestive of embodiment in other cognitive domains. recall, for example, that hearing the word “kick,” as opposed to “lick,” more strongly activates the somatotopic areas of primary motor cortex associated with the legs (Pulvermüller et al. 2005). though the proper interpretation of such findings is quite contentious on its own (see mahon and caramazza 2008), it is noteworthy that analogous cases are not observed for spatial perception: there are no analogous streams of research reporting that merely perceiving the spatial properties of one’s environment robustly and selec- tively activates brain areas for representing the body. And this is not for lack of looking: the vast literature on what is often called “scene perception” has investigated the neural bases of the perception of spatial layout, comparing experimental conditions in which subjects view images with rich 3d spatial content (such as navigable landscapes, fields, or indoor rooms) to baseline conditions in which subjects view images without such rich spatial content (such as faces, 2d collages of objects, or no image at all). However, such investigations have not implicated body‐related brain areas in perceiving such spatially rich visual environments, and certainly not with the specificity apparent in studies of embodiment in language processing (for the seminal work, see Epstein and Kanwisher 1998; for a recent review, see Oliva 2013).iii moreover, the diffuse patterns of activation associated with the “massive redeployment hypothesis” (for example, Anderson 2007, 2010) notably (and often explicitly) exclude visual perception:.though there is much discussion of how neural resources devoted to perception are themselves reused and redeployed in the brain, the meta‐ analytic data marshaled by the moderate approach to embodied cognition rarely (if ever) point to the reuse of other brain structures  for perception. Of course, none of these considerations entails that spatial perception is not embodied in the way imagined by the moderate approach. But it is well worth emphasizing that the motivations given for embodiment in general almost always fail to apply to visual percep- tion in particular, and the moderate approach is no exception. 4 Body‐Based Scaling in Visual Perception Let us return to the empirical evidence for embodiment in perception. A wealth of research has reported that bodily states such as the size of one’s hands or arms influence perception of spatial properties such as the size and distance of objects in the world, and the prevailing explanation for such effects is that the visual system “scales” the environ- ment by bodily representations (Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013; see also discussion in Goldman 2012). In the next two sections, I’ll argue that even if we assume that such bodily states affect spatial perception, and even if we further assume that they do so by body‐based “scaling,” we should still not consider this to be evidence in favor of the moderate approach to embodied cognition, because body‐based scaling does not recruit “B‐formats” in the way envisioned by the moderate approach. And in that case, no instance of such body‐based scaling will turn out to be an instance of moderately embodied cognition. 324 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 4.1 the case of eye‐height scaling to make the case that body‐based perceptual scaling is not moderately embodied cogni- tion, a somewhat involved analogy will be illustrative. Whereas the particular research on embodied influences on perception has been controversial (for a review, see Firestone 2013), it is noteworthy that the “scaling” theory put forward as an account of embodied perception – which is the basis for claiming that the “embodied perception” findings are instances of moderately embodied cognition  –  is grounded in much less contentious work: so‐called “eye‐height scaling” in size and distance perception (Ooi et  al. 2001; Sedgwick 1986; Wraga 1999). Eye‐height scaling is a hypothesized process by which the visual system is said to rep- resent spatial properties such as size and distance relative to the altitude of the observer’s eyes. (A nearby tree, say, might look 5 eye‐heights high and 10 eye‐heights away.) this account enjoys fairly wide acceptance (or at least little opposition) within vision science, in part because the theoretical and empirical foundation of such scaling accounts has been carefully worked out and scrutinized in the decades since they were first developed. Eye‐ height scaling also has more than the usual bona fides one might look for in an account of embodied cognition, having first been proposed by J. J.Gibson himself (see Gibson 1979, especially ch. 9, and the work of his student, Sedgwick 1986). this suggests a convenient way to evaluate the prospects for moderately embodied visual perception: by first deter- mining whether the more established cases of spatial‐perceptual scaling “count” as instances of embodied cognition according to the moderate approach. I will show that they plainly do not – and that it is only a short step from this result to a similar conclusion about the more recent evidence for embodied perception, which is widely assumed to operate on similar principles (Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013; Proffitt 2013). 4.1.1 Eye‐height scaling: the nuts and bolts We have been talking about perceiving the world “and representing spatial properties in”; what exactly does this mean, and how does the visual system achieve such body‐relative visual representation? Eye‐height scaling is one of many computational tricks the visual system uses to resolve ambiguity in visual information – for example, to determine from the ambiguous retinal size of an object whether it is large and far away or small and nearby. the insight of eye‐height scaling accounts is to notice that, in addition to the ambiguous information in the optic array, the optical information reaching the perceiver also contains a source of unambiguous size information, in the form of the visual horizon (that is, where earth appears to meet sky). the horizon appears to each observer at eye‐level, which means that every observer receives information about her own height relative to the rest of the world just by looking straight ahead. crucially, this information is invariant with the size or distance of any objects being viewed, because the horizon is essentially ‘projected’ onto objects in the environment: under normal viewing conditions, any object an observer sees is cut at eye‐level by the horizon. this allows the visual system to resolve certain ambiguities in visual information. consider the observer viewing the object in Figure 15.1a. the visual system’s job is to E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 325 determine the object’s physical size, but the object’s retinal size is ambiguous on its own; the object could be a big thing far away or a small thing close up. However, the horizon divides the object into two portions – A, the portion of the object above the horizon, and B, the portion of the object below the horizon – and the angular subtenses of these por- tions of the object (α and β) are related to each other in ways that track the size of the object and thus resolve the ambiguity. For example, a big thing far away is distinguishable from a small thing close up by the fact that the ratio (α + β)/β is greater for larger objects than for smaller objects (because α increases with the object’s size, but β does not). What does this have to do with perceiving space relative to one’s eye‐height? Since these relations holding between angular subtenses also hold between the sizes of the objects projecting those angles, we can set up the following equivalence: AB B (1) And since the horizon is what divides the object into A and B, and the horizon appears at eye‐level, we can notice that B is always equal to the observer’s own height (H): AB H (2) To Horizon (a) \u0000 \u0000 B A H (b) To Horizon H D \u0000 Figure 15.1 Eye‐height scaling in size and distance perception. 326 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n Or, simply: Size H (3) thus, an object’s size is given simply by (α + β)/β (an optic‐array structure commonly known as a “horizon ratio”), and the “units” associated with whatever this quantity works out to are units of the observer’s eye‐height. In other words, determining an object’s observer‐relative size is baked right into the process of using the horizon to disambiguate retinal size information; representing an object’s size by its horizon‐ratio just is comput- ing its observer‐relative size. Eye‐height scaling in distance perception is even simpler. consider the observer in Figure 15.1b, viewing an object a certain distance away. Here, the visual system’s job is to determine the object’s distance, but the angular information alone is again ambiguous. As before, however, the horizon resolves this ambiguity  –  this time not by projecting the observer’s eye‐height onto the object, but instead by anchoring the angle of declination from the horizon down to the object’s base. Assuming that the object is resting on the ground plane, the observer’s height and the distance to the object form two sides of a right triangle whose two acute angles are the angles of inclination and declination. these quan- tities are all related to each other by basic laws of trigonometry, such that the distance to the object can be expressed as follows: D H tan( ) (4) In other words, distance is given simply by tan(θ), and the units here are eye‐height units. Again, the visual system disambiguates retinal information about space by repre- senting space in units of the observer’s height. these examples should make clearer just what it means for the visual system to “scale” spatial properties relative to an aspect of the observer’s body  –  in this case, height. And it may also now be clearer why a shorter person might be said to experience objects in the world as being “farther” away than a taller person would, or why we our- selves often observe that childhood haunts seem smaller when revisited later in life: if the visual system sometimes represents spatial properties relative to the observer’s eye‐ height  –  if we can perceive sizes and distances in “units” of copies‐of‐me  –  then the shorter observer experiences objects in the world as being a greater number of eye‐ heights away or tall. this, in a nutshell, is the eye‐height scaling account of size and distance perception (for discussion of this account’s philosophical implications, see Bennett 2011). Helpfully, this understanding of the general nature of body‐based scaling accounts will also buy us “for free” an understanding of the body‐based scaling account favored by pro- ponents of embodied perception and moderately embodied cognition. the essential claim from embodied perception theorists (for example, Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013, who also work out the above derivation) is that, in a deep sense, embodied spatial perception works E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 327 like that. And as we will now see, this understanding has the consequence that none of these cases of body‐based scaling  –  whether by one’s height or by (for example) one’s arm‐ length – are instances of moderately embodied cognition. 4.2 Body‐based scaling ≠ embodiment Goldman (2013) has summarized his moderate notion of embodied as “the thesis that a significant amount of human cognition has its origins in representations of one’s own body” (104). At first glance, the upshot of eye‐height scaling looks awfully like an instance of embodied cognition on the moderate approach – so much so that one might wonder whether the moderate approach could simply declare victory on the basis of the above examples alone. Eye‐height scaling is an example of how the environment is perceived relative to the observer’s body, such that observers with different bodies literally perceive the world differently. Such scaling is also specific to one’s own body, which has been an important criterion for moderate embodiment; one person’s visual system cannot com- pute an object’s horizon‐ratio for some other person. most importantly, the role played by the observer’s height in influencing spatial perception in the above examples is not at all accidental, nor is it even merely causal; instead, on the sort of body‐based scaling account reviewed above, representations of the observer’s body play a genuinely constitutive role in spatial perception, because the cognitive processes underlying the visual system’s com- putation of spatial properties express those properties in eye‐level units. In the language of the moderate approach, eye‐height scaling is unambiguously an example of how “visual representations of object size are scaled by reference to one’s own bodily parts” (Goldman 2012: 82), a description Goldman uses for the flagship cases of moderately embodied visual perception. However, there is another sense in which eye‐height scaling has nothing to do with the body. now that we have seen the details of how the visual system actually derives eye‐ height‐scaled spatial representations, it is clear that the information processing that underlies body‐based scaling of this sort is entirely visual in nature, involving only geo- metric transformations on optical information. Even though the end result is body‐scaled size and distance, the visual system achieves this result by exploiting visual information created by the body (for example, the pitch of the declination angle, which is fixed by the observer’s height) – not by “redeploying” interoceptive bodily representations (for exam- ple, internally sensing one’s height). In fact, this sort of eye‐level scaling could occur even in systems without bodily representations at all, for example if such a process were imple- mented in a computer vision system analyzing photographs taken from above the ground plane (see, for instance, Herdtweck and Wallraven 2013). Body‐based scaling of this sort is thus “owned” entirely by the visual system: perception can and does represent space relative to the perceiver’s body without employing “B‐formats” of the sort envisioned by the moderate approach. Indeed, there would be some awkward consequences for the moderate approach if body‐based scaling accounts such as these were taken as instances of embodied cognition. most acutely, large swaths of visual processing that have long sat comfortably within 328 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n orthodox approaches to visual perception would suddenly (and spuriously) “count” as moderately embodied cognition as well. For example, one of the most robust visual cues to depth is the difference in an object’s apparent position between the two eyes (the “bin- ocular disparity”), which is exploited for depth perception by the process of stereopsis. (roughly, the greater the disparity, the closer the object.) Interestingly, due to the geom- etry of the binocular disparity, a popular characterization of depth perception by stereop- sis holds that its result is a body‐scaled representation of space  –  in particular, a representation of space scaled by the distance between the eyes (see, for example, Howard and rogers 1996; see also coats et al. 2014.) But if even stereopsis, which has been known for centuries (Wheatstone 1838) and is as mainstream and foundational a discovery as there could be in perceptual psychology, counts as an embodied cognitive process (since it involves body‐scaled representations), then the moderately embodied approach will have lost whatever value it sought to add to the relevant literatures – which was, after all, to “urge a reorientation” (Goldman 2012) in cognitive science. At least some instances of body‐based scaling, then, turn out not to require an “embod- ied” interpretation according to moderate approach, even though they are instances of how the visual system represents non‐bodily objects and properties by reference to the perceiver’s body. this is a result worth emphasizing on its own: it is a deep and subtle insight reached by body‐scaling accounts that the visual system exploits information created by the body to represent the environment in body‐relative terms, without rede- ploying interoceptive representations of the body. But we can also put this insight to further use, finally revealing that the theory developed to explain the “embodied percep- tion” effects reviewed earlier (for example, backpacks making hills look steeper, batons making distances look closer, etc.) has the consequence that these phenomena too are driven by processes that are not moderately embodied. 5 When Embodied Perception is not Embodied Cognition Equipped with the insight that the mind can and does derive body‐scaled representations of non‐bodily spatial extents without doing anything that should reasonably count as embodied cognition on the moderate approach, we are in a position to see how the exper- imental evidence and theoretical accounts presented by embodied approaches to percep- tion also fail to be instances of moderately embodied cognition. the prevailing theory of how the sizes of our hands, lengths of our arms, and extents of our jumps (etc.) affect perception of spatial quantities is that, just as with eye‐height, the visual system can scale space by those body parts. In the words of embodied perception theorists, “eye‐height is not the only bodily metric used to scale space, but rather is part of a larger ensemble of perceptual rulers” (Linkenauger et al. 2011: 1434). Importantly, these additional body‐ based perceptual rulers are assumed to achieve such body‐based scaling in a way rele- vantly similar to how eye‐height scaling is achieved  –  by transformations that exploit regularities and patterns in the optic array, as opposed to the combination or integration of visual information with interoceptive body representations of the sort the moderate approach identifies with “B‐formats.” On this theory, the role played by our hands, arms, E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 329 and legs in influencing spatial perception is essentially the same as the role height plays in influencing spatial perception in the above examples (which, we have just established, are not instances of moderately embodied cognition). According to Goldman, what makes the “embodied perception” findings instances of moderately embodied cognition is not simply the experimental results themselves, but rather the body‐based scaling theory underlying them. But in their most comprehensive statement of their views, Proffitt and Linkenauger (2013) make clear  –  rightly, in my view – that their scaling theory is very opposed to the interpretation that would be required by the moderate approach to embodied cognition. For example, they note that an earlier review (Proffitt 2006) included passages that “could be understood as suggesting that visual and non‐visual information are combined in perception, thereby making percep- tion a hybrid, consisting of information of mixed perceptual and non‐perceptual origins. We do not ascribe to this hybrid view” (Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013: 171). Instead, they argue that “the visually perceived environment is fully specified by visual information,” and that “visual information is not combined with, but rather is scaled by, non‐visual metrics derived from the body” (171) before going through the derivation of eye‐height scaling as the paradigmatic example of what they mean by this. iv Even by the lights of embodied perception theorists, then, these instances of body‐based perceptual scaling are not instances of embodied cognition in the sense intended by the moderate approach.v moreover, it easy to see why embodied perception theorists interpret their data this way, rather than along the lines of the moderate approach. Looking through the collection of embodied perception studies, it is noteworthy that just about every study that manipu- lates the subject’s body or action‐capabilities also manipulates the visual information reaching the subject. In the clearest cases, this is simply because subjects can directly see the manipulated body part that would serve as the effector in the relevant action (for example, looking at one’s own hand while grasping a baton before reaching for a target; Witt et al. 2005). In other cases, the manipulation would likely have perturbed the optic flow reaching the subject in some other way (e.g., wearing ankle weights while jumping over a gap; Lessard et  al. 2009; see also the discussion of optic flow in Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013 and Proffitt 2013). Perhaps most crucially, several embodied perception studies succeed despite manipu- lating only the visual information reaching the subject, without actually altering the sub- ject’s true action‐capabilities or interoceptive bodily representations. For example, subjects who placed their hands in a magnifying box such that their hands looked larger (but, of course, were not in fact larger, and did not feel larger, etc.) subsequently judged graspable blocks to be smaller (Linkenauger et al. 2011); similarly, immersing subjects in a virtual environment and altering the depicted hand‐size of their virtual avatars report- edly influenced the perceived sizes of virtual objects reached with the enlarged hand (Linkenauger et al. 2013). Such results should be inexplicable on the view that the embodied perception findings are explained by the redeployment of interoceptive body representations (involving B‐formats), since the interoceptive information reaching the subject was held constant across the experimental conditions, and there was thus no change in the B‐formatted representations that supposedly serve as scaling metrics. Instead, if, as the moderate 330 E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n approach insists, we are to understand these results as involving spatial‐perceptual scaling of some kind (for an alternative view, see Firestone 2013), then the only non‐deflationary interpretation available is that body‐based scaling of this sort operates by transformations on visual information, just as does every other sort of body‐based scaling. thus, having previously seen that body‐based scaling in visual perception does not generally require (or involve) the redeployment of B‐formats, we have now also seen that the work on embodied perception – which constitutes the only evidence so far marshaled in favor of moderately embodied visual perception – shares this property, and thus that these results too should not be taken as examples of moderately embodied cognition. 6 Conclusion: Moving Forward, Moderately I have argued that a large class of empirical and theoretical evidence that may initially appear to support the moderate notion of embodied visual perception turns out not to show (or even suggest) that vision is embodied. Is this because of some defect in the mod- erate approach’s criteria for embodiment? I believe the answer is no, and that the moder- ate approach to embodied cognition remains a refreshing and potentially game‐changing approach to understanding the nature and extent of body‐based influences in the mind. What went wrong, then, with the moderate approach’s claims about visual perception? the core criterion for the moderate notion of embodiment – involving the recruitment and redeployment of body‐representing systems for non‐bodily tasks – seems right on target. Instead, I take the foregoing discussion to have shown that this core criterion is very slightly out of step with the broader spirit of the moderate approach – a spirit illus- trated by what Goldman (2013) calls a “slogan” for his view: “In the beginning, what we represent is our own body” (104). As the various cases of body‐based scaling in perception show, the mind constructs body‐oriented representations that meet many of the in‐spirit conditions for moderate embodiment put forward by Goldman, and yet do not involve the recruitment of internal, body‐representing systems, and so are not instances of embodied cognition on the moderate approach. Something has to give: either the moderate approach can abandon the claim that visual perception is embodied, or the criteria for embodiment could be tweaked so that body‐ based perceptual scaling does count as moderately embodied visual perception. It seems to me that the latter option is unadvisable: as we have seen from the example of stereopsis, inviting perceptual scaling into the moderate approach’s notion of embodied cognition would have unacceptable consequences for an approach that is supposed to mark a “distinctive departure from orthodox cognitive science” (Goldman 2013: 104). the most favorable solution, then, is to accept that body‐based scaling in visual perception  –  of which the “embodied perception” findings are intended as an exam- ple – does not meet the moderate approach’s criteria for embodiment. It is no indictment of the moderate approach that the clarity and incisiveness of these criteria helped us see that such cases are not truly instances of embodied cognition; indeed, it is clearly a strength, even if the consequence is that less of cognition is embodied than originally hoped. But this is, after all, not a wholly unexpected outcome: visual perception was E m BO d I m E nt I n  PE r c EP t IO n 331 an awkward case study of embodiment all along, given the moderate approach’s evolu- tionary motivations. If the moderate approach can let go of embodied visual perception (at least on the basis of currently available evidence), then it can – and surely will – continue to make gains in the rest of the mind. Notes i Goldman (2013) clarifies that if “code” or “format” in this context sounds overly language‐like, then “using a body‐oriented format” could be understood as roughly equivalent to “recruiting a body‐representing system.” I will understand the notion of a “B‐format” in this sense. ii Of course, many exceptions and puzzles are lurking even in these cases. For example, if our ability to understand action verbs such as “kick” and “lick” relies in some deep way on the redeployment of neural circuitry for programming and executing such movements, then what of our apparently equal ability to understand the verbs “fly” or “slither ”? Are these otherwise‐ similar classes of words processed by entirely different cognitive mechanisms? See mahon and caramazza (2008) for a discussion of these and other worries. iii there is evidence that (e.g.) viewing images of graspable tools activates motor regions associ- ated with grasping (for a review, see culham and Valyear 2006). However, these sorts of results do not bear on the claim that spatial perception itself is embodied; instead, such results may be more suggestive that recognizing tools or planning to use them can involve simulations of their use (modulo the persistent obstacles in interpreting such fmrI data along these lines). Just as the claim in the “kick”/“lick” case is that merely understanding such words is embodied, the claim here is that merely perceiving the spatial properties of the environment is embodied. iv Goldman (2012) may have even unintentionally flipped this passage’s meaning in discussing the moderate approach. In quoting it, he adds the word “merely” in parentheses, such that the end result is “visual information is not [merely] combined with, but rather is scaled by, non‐ visual metrics derived from the body” (Goldman, 2012: 84). But I take it that Proffitt and Linkenauger simply meant what they wrote  –  that visual information is not combined with non‐visual metrics derived from the body, full‐stop. v It is further telling that “motor simulation,” a notion briefly flirted with by a single embodied perception study (Witt and Proffitt 2008), makes no appearance in the theoretical treatments of embodied perception (e.g., Proffitt and Linkenauger 2013; Proffitt, 2013) – especially as per- tains to the “scaling” account. this continues to suggest that the redeployment of body‐repre- senting systems is not a feature of such accounts in the way that would be required by the moderate notion of embodiment.

It presents my “moderate” approach to embodied cognition with great clarity; it shows appreciation for the novelty of the approach as compared with other proposals; and it sees the advance of this approach over its rivals. Firestone generously compliments it as a “refreshing and potentially game‐changing approach.” that was the good news, of course. In the rest of the chapter, Firestone focuses on a particular example explored in detail in Goldman (2012), a putative example of moderate embodiment in perception. His verdict on this example is thumbs down. It just isn’t really an example of embodied cognition according to my own criteria. (A few explan- atory remarks will follow shortly.) What is my response? Firestone is correct; he has convinced me of his negative thesis. When properly interpreted, he argues, the phenomenon of “body‐scaling” borrowed from dennis Proffitt and colleagues turns out not to be an instance of cognition in the B‐format sense. the remainder of this brief reply considers the consequences one might wish to draw from this concession. the quickest and easiest move is one that Firestone himself anticipates: the proffered example of moderate embodied cognition simply doesn’t live it up to its billing. Just forget it, then. What do I stand to lose? In (Goldman 2013) my central thesis about embodied cognition is formulated as follows: “a significant amount of human cognition has its origins in representations of one’s own body” (p. 104). the phrase “a significant‐amount” certainly leaves plenty of wiggle room. the satisfaction of such a criterion is by no means endangered if we choose to drop the original claim that perception (or much of it) is embodied. Innumerable other possible examples of embodiment are out there in possibility space. Quite a few of these were sketched in Goldman (2012); and even Firestone raises reply to Firestone 336 r EPL Y t O   FI r ES t O n E no issue about them. So let’s stop worrying; there’s no reason to abandon our proposal or try to dilute it so as to please parties of every stripe. Ending the discussing in this fashion, however, might be a bit abrupt and arguably sub‐optimal. As Firestone points out, there is another alternative: tweak the criteria for embodiment so that body‐based perceptual scaling also counts as moderately embodied. Let us explore this possibility. First, let us review Firestone’s reason for denying that body‐based scaling in visual perception exemplifies the criteria for B‐format based embodiment. Firestone explains that the information‐processing that underlies body‐based scaling in perception is entirely visual in nature, involving only geometric transformations on optical information. the visual system achieves its result by exploiting visual information created by the body, not by “redeploying” interoceptive bodily representations (for example, internally sensing one’s height). Perception can and does represent space relative to the perceiver’s body, but without employing B‐formats. So, what kind of tweaking would accommodate visual perception as embodiment? One obvious possibility would be to introduce a disjunctive criterion of embodiment: either embodiment in the B‐formats sense or embodiment in the sense of one’s body having a causal effect on a given type of cognition. the second disjunct was one of the earliest characterizations of embodiment that Vignemont and I considered in our joint paper (Goldman and de Vignemont 2009). Here was one formulation: there is embodied cognition when one’s actions and other body‐related traits (for example, posture) have an important causal role in cognition. the trouble is that really trivial cases would satisfy this criterion, thereby allowing cognitions to qualify as embodied far too readily. nobody doubts that opening or closing one’s eyes affects one’s perceptions. Is this a reason to allow perception to qualify as embodied? down this road, therefore, lies far too permis- sive a condition for embodiment. It would utterly trivialize the notion of embodiment cognition. Better, then, to stick with the B‐format conceptions of embodiment as originally proposed, and not disjunctivize it with a second conception, even if it means abandoning the visual perception example proposed earlier (for Firestone’s reason).

Cognitive Science and Metaphysics Partners in Debunking J o na than S C haffer 16 George Bealer does it. Roderick Chisholm does it a lot. Most philosophers do it openly and unapologetically, and the rest arguably do it too, although some of them would deny it. What they all do is appeal to intuitions in constructing, shaping, and refining their philosophical views. (Kornblith 1998: 129) Is cognitive science relevant to metaphysics? From the perspective of a realist metaphysi- cian aiming to describe the objective structure of reality itself, it may be natural to think that cognitive science is largely irrelevant. It may seem that cognitive science could at most shed light on folk metaphysics, which concerns the contours of our conception of the world and not the structure of reality itself. Folk metaphysics may seem as irrelevant to real metaphysics as folk physics is to real physics. Yet Goldman (1992, 1993, 2007, 2015; also Paul 2010a) argues that cognitive science is relevant to metaphysics. I take his core point to be that some arguments in metaphysics are premised on intuitions, and that cognitive science is relevant to assessing what we find intuitive, and whether a given intuition should be respected or debunked. In short: cogni- tive science is relevant to metaphysics via the debunking project. For instance, suppose one believed – following Kripke (1980) – in the modal essentiality of origins on the basis of intuitions about certain thought experiments, but one then discovered that those very intuitions were produced by a cognitive module one had independent reason to believe was broken. Then one’s basis for believing in the essentiality of origins would be debunked. To put this point in other terms: folk metaphysics is evidentially relevant to real meta- physics (in a way that folk physics is not relevant to real physics). And so cognitive science, by illuminating folk metaphysics, casts indirect light on real metaphysics. 338 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS I am convinced. I agree with Goldman that cognitive science is relevant to metaphysics via the debunking project. But I offer two adjustments (or perhaps just elaborations) to Goldman’s picture. First, I take the relevance of cognitive science to be not specific to metaphysics, but rather to be generic to any intellectual inquiry that invokes intuitions. Secondly – and perhaps more importantly – I take metaphysics itself to play a crucial role alongside cognitive science within the debunking project. For a crucial part of the debunk- ing project is selecting when to debunk, and a crucial part of selecting when to debunk is assessing whether the intuition fits reality (or when the module is failing to track reality). So in place of Goldman’s one‐way slogan that cognitive science is relevant to metaphysics, I prefer to say that cognitive science and metaphysics serve as partners within the wider debunking project. visually the difference between Goldman and I may be depicted as in Figures 16.1 and 16.2 (with arrows representing relevance). I do not know whether Goldman would disagree with my picture, or regard it as just an elaboration of his own. I am after all agreeing with Goldman that there is a pathway of relevance from cognitive science to metaphysics via the assessment of intuitions (the “debunking” box). I am then adding, first, that the debunking project does not specifically target metaphysics but rather has a generic impact on any intellectual inquiry that invokes intuitions. But that addition is clearly in line with Goldman’s (1992: 1–6) overarching idea that cognitive science proves relevant throughout philosophy. I am also adding a second root node for metaphysics, representing my claim that cogni- tive science and metaphysics are partners in the debunking project. If I have any major disagreement with Goldman (note the “if ”), it is here. on my picture there is no “external vantage‐point” from which to critique metaphysics, nor is there any prospect that cogni- tive science can take on the debunking project alone. The assessment of intuitions relevant to metaphysics is in part a metaphysical assessment. This proves relevant to the extent to which one can appeal to cognitive science to defeat naïve realism, and proves relevant to the places where I criticize Goldman for overreaching against naïve realism. It also proves relevant to general issues of philosophical methodology, and the not‐always‐acknowledged place of metaphysics therein.

Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 339 If I have any criticism to make of Goldman’s work on cognitive science and metaphysics, it is not that he overplays the role of cognitive science, but that he underplays the role of metaphysics. Before proceeding, I pause to avert two potential misunderstandings. Firstly, no one is denying that there may be other connections between cognitive science and metaphysics. For instance, if – as Wittgenstein (1969: 36e) imagines – our skulls were filled with saw- dust, this presumably would make trouble for some metaphysical theories of mind such as mind‐brain identity theories. I only mean to follow Goldman in tracing out one particular connection (via the debunking project). Secondly, no one is assuming that there is any true unity to cognitive science or metaphysics. Perhaps these disciplines are unified merely by family resemblances and academic politics. Again I only mean to follow Goldman in detailing a particular task of debunking intuitions, and then to further elabo- rate the connection(s) with one’s background picture of reality. Overview: In section 1 I make the general case for metaphysics as a required partner to cognitive science in the debunking project, for providing an external standard to assess intuitions. In sections 2 and 3 I consider the specific case studies of color, temporal passage, and spatial unity. These illustrate the general role of metaphysics in debunking, while also shedding more light on the interplay between cognitive science and metaphysics. 1 Metaphysics for Debunking 1.1 Goldman’s liaison Is cognitive science relevant to metaphysics? I think that cognitive science is generically relevant to any field of inquiry featuring arguments premised on intuitions, because cog- nitive science has a role to play in assessing what we find intuitive, and whether a given intuition should be respected or debunked (which I am labeling “the debunking project”). on this point I follow Goldman (2015), who writes: What lies “behind” commonsense intuitions, experiences, and judgments (which metaphysics use as prima facie guides to the nature of reality) should be probed, including what can be gleaned from the scientific study of the cognitive engine. I call this idea Goldman’s liaison, since I take it to be Goldman’s core insight on the matter: Goldman’s liaison: Cognitive science is relevant to debunking intuitions, including those used in metaphysics. I do not claim that Goldman’s liaison is original with Goldman. Indeed the background idea of looking to the mind to critique our naïve view of reality perhaps runs through the history of philosophy. But I take Goldman to be the leading contemporary exponent and developer of the view. i 340 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS My use of the terms “intuitions” and “debunking” may be misleading, for I mean both very broadly. Under “intuitions” I include commonsense beliefs and sensory seemings, since  –  as Goldman (forthcoming) is explicit  –  these are all cognitive outputs whose evidential bearing on metaphysics needs to be assessed: The metaphysician’s initial evidence bearing on the theories would be a set of ordinary expe- riences, intuitions, or beliefs about the domain that each theory tries to accommodate in its own way. A basic assumption here is that such experiences, intuitions, and beliefs are exam- ples of evidence that metaphysicians (legitimately) use when weighing competing theories. Likewise under “debunking” I include all assessments of these cognitive outputs, where the assessment could in the end be one of respecting the output, or even in principle (Goldman personal communication) one of boosting the evidential force of the output. I use “the debunking project” and speak of “debunking intuitions” as metonyms for the more general project of assessing cognitive outputs for evidentiary force, in part because this aspect of the project tends to attract the most interest. It might help to distinguish Goldman’s liaison from other theses in the vicinity. To begin with, given the holism of confirmation, everything is relevant to everything. Following duhem and Quine, Fodor (1983: 105) notes: “[T]he facts relevant to the confir- mation of a scientific hypothesis may be drawn from anywhere… In principle, our botany constrains our astronomy, if only we could think of ways to make them connect.” Goldman’s liaison goes beyond an utterly generic claim of the form: “everything is rele- vant to everything; a fortiori, cognitive science is relevant to metaphysics.” It identifies a definite way in which cognitive science and metaphysics connect, namely via the assess- ment of intuitions. ii There is also a sense in which cognitive science might be thought to have something very specific to say just about metaphysics. For instance, in a broadly “Kantian” vein one might think that there are certain specific questions – “metaphysical” as said with a sneer – which lie beyond the ken of human cognition. If there is such a very specific sort of relevance, Goldman’s liaison does not attempt to describe it. Goldman’s liaison identifies a definite way in which cognitive science and metaphysics connect, but only by in effect grouping metaphysics under the more general heading of inquiries featuring arguments premised on intuitions. When the metaphysician argues from intuitions about when mereological composition occurs, she is  –  from the perspective of Goldman’s liaison – doing the same thing as when the epistemologist argues from intuitions about when knowledge is present, when the philosopher of language argues from intuitions about what a word means, or when the ethicist argues from intuitions about what actions are required. In all these cases one can ask whether the intuition should be respected or debunked. Goldman’s liaison is compatible with any combination of views on these other theses. I myself would accept the general holism of confirmation, but would not accept the claim that there is something specifically defective about metaphysics (see Bennett 2016).iii But for present purposes these should by regarded as largely independent matters. Though since I argue that metaphysics plays a crucial role alongside cognitive science within the Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 341 debunking project, I am in effect arguing that those who would reject metaphysics thereby bar themselves from participating in the debunking project in the first place. (The cost of rejecting metaphysics just got higher.) Goldman’s liaison does embed a particular conception of at least some lines of meta- physical inquiry, namely as being inquiries that draw on intuitions. But I think it does so in a highly uncontroversial way. First of all, no assumptions are made about what intui- tions are. I am using the term “intuition” in the broadest sense, including naïve beliefs, or dispositions to believe, or sui generis states of seeming true. iv My own view is that we enjoy beliefs, dispositions to believe, and states of seeming true, and that each of these is invoked in various places in metaphysics, and that each of these is open to assessment and potential debunking. But Goldman’s liaison requires no stand on the matter. Secondly, no assumptions are made as to whether intuitions feature in the content of a given premise or merely as the rationale for the premise. Perhaps the relevant premise in a case of modality might be “intuitively, it is not possible to have water without h2o” or perhaps the relevant premise is merely “it is not possible to have water without h 2o” where the justification for this premise would be that it is intuitive.v My own view is that both are eligible to serve as premises, and that each of them is open to assessment and potential debunking. But again Goldman’s liaison requires no stand on the matter. It is only assumed that intuitions, whatever they may be, are used in some way or another. even this may seem controversial. For instance Cappelen (2012) argues that intuitions play no real role in philosophy, and that there is merely a bad stylistic reflex in the discipline now to insert “intuitively” in place of stating a reason. My own view is that philosophers have tended to use “intuitively” to mean intuitively, and that this has an evidential meaning requiring a kind of immediate judgment.vi But in any case Cappelen would say that one should just replace “intuitively” with a direct evaluation of the (worldly, non‐psychologized) claim at issue. Goldman’s liaison can still come in here, since there is still room to assess and perhaps debunk our capacities for a direct evaluation of a given worldly claim. So in that sense I take Goldman’s liaison to use “intuition” in an ines- sential way (cf. Cappelen 2012: 224–7), merely as a pointer to whatever exactly is going on, in  metaphysics and elsewhere, when philosophers assert premises which they call “intuitive.” Think what you will of intuitions. I take it that everyone needs to make sense of the prospect of debunking, in which certain beliefs (typically folk beliefs) are shown to be evi- dentially defeated. The friend of Goldman’s liaison is really committed to two essential claims: • Cognitive science is relevant to debunking, and • Some claims in metaphysics are potentially open to debunking. Talk of intuitions is only coming in as a mediator between these two claims: the claims in metaphysics that are potentially open to debunking are intuitions, and cognitive science is relevant to the debunking of these very intuitions. So anyone who would make sense of debunking can make sense of Goldman’s liaison, whether or not they like to posit intuitions as playing this mediating role. 342 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 1.2 The debunking project evolution suggests that human cognition is a powerful but flawed tool. on the one hand it is plausible that many of our cognitive faculties evolved to help us with the four ‘F’s (feeding, fighting, fleeing, and reproduction), and plausible that this pressured our ances- tors towards reliably tracking the environment. on the other hand it is equally plausible that many of our cognitive faculties evolved to give us quick and dirty heuristics reliable only for limited purposes in evolutionarily salient contexts. In particular, some of our intuitions seem insightful. People naturally intuit, when shown two hands, that – in the words of Moore (1993: 166) – “here is one hand and here is another.” People naturally intuit that 2 + 3 = 5. Barring radical skepticism, it seems that our native endowments actually guide us in the right direction in these cases. But some of our intuitions seem to be crude superstitions. People intuit that the earth is flat, and that animate spirits dwell in trees, rivers, and rocks. If science has taught us anything at all, it seems that some of our naïve prejudices deserve to be debunked. Thus consider the intuition that animate spirits dwell in trees, rivers, and rocks, as a paradigm case of an intuition that needs debunking. I take it that the debunking project, as applied to this case, has at least three connected components. First, there is a psycho- logical story to tell – in this case involving what Boyer (2001; cf. Guthrie 1993; Bloom 2007) calls a “hypertrophy of social cognition” – in which we tend to over‐ attribute psy- chological agency (our “theory of mind module” delivers many false‐positives). In this vein Bloom (2007: 149) notes: The classical demonstration here is that of heider and Simmel (1944), who made a simple movie in which geometric figures – circles, squares, and triangles – moved in certain system- atic ways, designed, based on the psychologists’ intuitions, to tell a tale. When shown this movie, people instinctively described the figures as if they were specific people (bullies, vic- tims, heroes) who have goals and desires…vii But secondly – and most crucially for my purposes – there is a background metaphysical picture in play, informed in part by science, against which one judges the intuitions. I presume that it is false that animate spirits dwell in trees, rivers, and rocks. I presume that it is false that the geometric shapes in heider and Simmel’s movie are agents with real goals and desire. There is nothing internally incoherent about accepting these animist intuitions as respectable, and holding that rocks and movie images of triangles are really agents. It is only because the intuition conflicts with my background metaphysical picture that I seek to debunk it. Likewise I do not seek to debunk the intuition that here is a hand, or that 2 + 3 = 5, because in fact I think that these intuitions fit the world. Thirdly, given the psychological story and the background metaphysical picture, there is an epistemic account to be given of how the animistic intuition loses evidential standing. For the sake of definiteness I will take on an epistemological backstory on which intuitions pro- vide prima facie justification for belief, which converts to ultima facie justification in the absence of ultimately undefeated defeaters. viii The loss of evidential standing involved in debunking can then be identified with defeat. ix So the picture looks as given in Figure 16.3. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 343 This is not the only way the epistemological story may be told. For instance, for those – no doubt including Goldman (1979) himself – who favor a more reliabilist‐ori- ented backstory, there may be ways to think of defeat in reliabilist terms (see nichols 2014, esp. section 2 on “process debunking”; see generally Grundmann 2009). x or for those – including myself – who favor a relevant alternative theory, one may think of defeat in terms of the relevance of alternatives in which the mind is misreading the world (see Lewis 1996: 558). The epistemological backstory may even be told in more minimal terms, by replacing “loss of evidential standing” with the weaker idea of some lowering of rational posterior credence. Goldman (2015) – at least for one cluster of cases (the pro- jections: section  3.1)  –  takes up a Bayesian model with some limited constraints on rational priors, to associate debunking with at least some dampening of rational poste- rior credence. The epistemological backstory is more of a fixed background. It provides the machin- ery of debunking, into which the psychological and metaphysical inputs are fed, and an epistemic verdict on a given intuition is then issued as output. (For this reason I do not include an “epistemology” box into the input to “debunking” in my picture of the terrain.) nothing I say in the main text should depend on the details of the epistemologi- cal backstory. I am only supposing that the epistemological backstory has the resources to say why the psychological story about the hypertrophy of social cognition, together with the metaphysical story on which animism is to be rejected, can work together to show how animistic intuitions lack sufficient evidential standing to engender ultima facie justified belief. Any viable epistemology should find a way to make sense of debunking.xi What emerges from this paradigm case of a belief that needs debunking are three cru- cial and interconnected aspects of the debunking project: • The psychological aspect: debunking requires identifying the psychological mech- anisms involved in the production of the intuition and showing them to work in a certain way. • The metaphysical aspect: debunking requires painting in the background metaphysical picture so as to establish that the psychological mechanism is going wrong by working in this way. • The epistemological aspect: debunking requires showing how an intuition produced by psychological mechanism gone wrong in this way thereby loses evidential standing. For present purposes the crucial point is the second bulleted point. even given a fixed epistemic backstory, cognitive science cannot go it alone when it comes to debunking, but requires metaphysics as a partner. What follows is primarily an elaboration of this point. Intuition Prima facie justiﬁed belief Absence of defeat Ultima facie justiﬁed belief Figure 16.3 epistemological backstory for defeat. 344 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 1.3 Metaphysics for selectivity Given that human cognition is a powerful but flawed tool one should expect selective debunking. human cognition is not a complete disaster. Barring radical skepticism, some of our intuitions deserve respecting. But human cognition is equally not a perfect oracle. If science has taught us anything at all, some of our intuitions deserve debunking. I have already suggested some candidates for intuitions to be respected (Moore’s “here is one hand and here is another”, 2 + 3 = 5), as well as intuitions to be debunked (the earth is flat, animate spirits dwell in nature). But leaving these specific candidates aside, I take it as non‐negotiable that some intuitions should be respected but others should be debunked. no other attitude fits a naturalistic conception of human cognition as a powerful but flawed tool. (Indeed the very prospect of an unselective story raises self‐undermining concerns. An unselective story in which all intuitions are to be respected is self‐undermining, given – as I take to be the case – that among our intuitions is the very intuition that some of our intuitions deserve debunking. But worse, an unselective story in which all intuitions are to be debunked is self‐undermining, given that the debunking project is itself premised on certain intuitions including an intuitive epistemological backstory about defeat.xii) The need for selective debunking invites the question: When should an intuition be respected and when should it be debunked? one bad answer – bad because unselective – is that an intuition can be debunked when one can tell a cognitive story about how it arises. This is unselective because of course there is always some cognitive story to be told about every cognitive output, intuitions included. Cognitive outputs are not miracles. They all have causal aetiologies through our cognitive engines. A second bad answer – also bad because unselective – is that an intuition should be debunked when it can be triggered in error. This is unselective because every human cognitive process is fallible and can be triggered in error. We can make mistakes even about simple visual beliefs and simple arithmetical beliefs. If perfection is needed for evidential standing then nothing stands. A better version of this second answer is that an intuitions should be debunked when it is often triggered in error, or more generally when it is unreliable as an indicator of real- ity. (This fits the reliabilist backstory of Goldman 1979, and also Goldman’s (2015) anal- ogy between debunking intuitions and discovering when a gas gauge is stuck.) This offers a more selective answer. But it is one that requires a metaphysical component, for to assess what is and what is not reliable as an indicator of reality, one needs some conception of what is out there in reality. By reliabilist lights, debunking requires comparing the cogni- tive output to the metaphysical facts, in order to measure their degree of correlation. But leaving reliabilism aside, on any reasonable theory of debunking the informa- tion that a given intuition does not fit reality should suffice for debunking. This is selective (not every intuition fails to fit reality), and it defeats any prima facie justifica- tion the intuition provides. I am claiming that metaphysics is needed to answer the question of when to debunk. An intuition should be debunked when it fails to fit the world, by failing to find a place in the background metaphysical picture, as presumably informed by science. Thus I say: • Metaphysics for selectivity: determining whether a given intuition deserves debunking requires determining whether it fits reality. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 345 When I spoke of the metaphysical aspect of the debunking project (section 1.2), it was by way of helping render debunking selective. But the need for a background metaphysical picture comes out not only in explaining why we debunk in particular cases (for example, naïve animism: section 1.2), but also in the very idea of assessing a folk theory on anything more than internal grounds of coher- ence. A crucial part of that further assessment is in terms of an external comparison with reality. The background metaphysical picture is providing the external standard against which folk conceptions may be judged for fit. In short: our intuitions may be assessed for internal coherence and for external fit with reality. The latter is a metaphysical assessment. What is this background metaphysical picture, and where does it come from? The pic- ture is our conception of the objective and intrinsic nature of reality. I leave open how this should be understood, so long as it is understood as whatever is making us opt to debunk intuitions of naive animism.xiii The picture needs to be informed by science, but science itself just gives us models and equations, which themselves stand in need of metaphysi- cal interpretation. or perhaps better: science itself is continuous with and commingled with metaphysical inquiry. So the background metaphysical picture itself must draw on intui- tions (including those used in preferring a given interpretation of science). In that sense one is seeing a kind of feedback loop in which an initial intuitive metaphysical picture, augmented with information from physics and cognitive science (inter alia), is being used to assess itself and reach a wider reflective equilibrium. Such a loop is implicit in my picture diagrammed in Figure 16.2, in which I label two boxes as “metaphysics,” but equally could have drawn things with a single “metaphysics” box and a loop, as in Figure 16.4. In any case, invoking the metaphysical aspect of the debunking project as part of the answer to the question of when to debunk has two immediate consequences. First it resit- uates metaphysics from being the target of debunking to being a crucial part of the machinery of debunking itself. But secondly it shows how considerations from cognitive science alone cannot be expected to defeat the hardened naïve realist. For the naïve realist who would insist that colors, morals, or spirits are part of reality may thereby resist the call to debunk, simply by clinging to their metaphysics and claiming that the relevant intuitions fit reality. 1.4 Can cognitive science fly solo? Is there any alternative to invoking a metaphysical aspect to debunking (as per Metaphysics for selectivity)? In particular, are there any purely internal signs of defective cognition, such that cognitive science could all by itself discern when debunking is called for and Cognitive science Debunking Metaphysics Epistemology …all other areas of inquiry that invoke intuitons… Figure 16.4 Schaffer’s picture re‐drawn with a loop. 346 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS when not? of course the folk theory may itself be incomplete, or incoherent in various respects. (It is an empirical psychological matter whether this is so.) But it may not be. And even if the folk theory is incomplete or incoherent, one may still want to assess vari- ous completions of the theory, or various coherent portions of the theory. Is there any way that cognitive science could – on its own – fully assess a complete and coherent (refine- ment of) folk theory? It is hard to answer such a question in the abstract, but there is a tempting idea which I think does not work, involving the idea of hermetic cognition. Goldman (1993: 123), in discussing the debunking of modal beliefs about essences, says: how exactly might cognitive science contribute to this conclusion [that we are not in touch with an extra‐mental modal fact]? It might be in a position (eventually, if not now) to assure us that there is a cognitivist story to be told that explains the existence of our intuitive reac- tions and their inter‐personal uniformity without appeal to any “detection” of extra‐mental modal facts. We might then be in the situation of those who reject the inference from reli- gious experience to theism on grounds that the religious experience can be explained purely psychologically, without reference to divine sources. Likewise Goldman (2015) – following Joyce (2006) and Street (2006) in discussing the case of debunking moral beliefs – says: Cognitive science can weigh in on this question. It certainly studies perceptual systems (also called “senses”) and sometimes discovers new ones. Comparative cognitive science discovered echolocation in bats. human cognitive neuroscience has discovered many types of interoceptive senses in the human brain, i.e., brain mechanisms for monitoring the positions and conditions of one’s own bodily organs… There is no comparable discovery of any moral sense, whether an exteroceptive sense or an interoceptive sense. This might be interpreted as evidence against the existence of any sense for tracking moral truths… So one might look for the following internal sign of lack of fit with external reality: the intuition is generated by a cognitive system that is disconnected from reality, in the sense of lacking any plausible way of detecting or otherwise tracking the truths it claims to deliver. In other words, the cognitive system lacks the right input profile to render these intuitions suitably connected to the world. The cognitive system may be dismissed as hermetically sealed off from the world, without judgment as to what there might be out in the world. But first, being hermetic is not necessary for debunking. A cognitive system can come equipped with all sorts of sensory transducers and still deliver intuitions that deserve debunking if the affiliated sensory system is sufficiently poor, or if the system itself is doing poor things with its sensory input. Some of the intuitions generated by our folk physics module are presumably of the latter sort. The folk physics module seems strongly connected to perceptual inputs. only it encodes some false assumptions about reality, and when it generates intuitions solely on this basis, such intuitions deserve debunking.xiv Likewise in the case of color – to be discussed in some detail in section 2 – the problem is evidently not a lack of any sensory input from the world. So metaphysics is still needed to determine when to debunk, for cognitive systems that are highly connected to the world. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 347 More interestingly, being hermetic is not sufficient for debunking either. A cognitive system can lack any relevant sensory transducers and still deliver intuitions that deserve respecting. Indeed, presumably our capacities for abstract logical and math- ematical reasoning are subserved by capacities without any relevantly direct links to perception. (There is no “inner eye” turned upwards to Platonic heaven.) So, barring a radical “debunking” all of our abstract intuitions in one fell swoop, one needs to allow respectable intuitions severed from any direct perceptual input. how could these intuitions be respectable? There might still be evolutionary pressure, for instance, for these modules to conform to mind‐independent mathematical structure, even if  these  modules are not directly informed by this structure. So there might be some evolutionary pressure towards carrying a sealed‐off but still reliable map of mathematical reality.xv Indeed – returning to the case of morality – it seems at least possible that there is a mind‐independent moral structure which typically mandates cooperative familial and social relationships. And there are natural evolutionary pressures that could have led our ancestors to seek cooperative familial and social relationships, and punish those who defected from this moral behavior. In that case there might even be some evolutionary pressure towards carrying a sealed‐off but reliable map of “moral reality.” (I am not saying that this is a plausible story, and I am not saying that morality in the end deserves respect- ing; I am only explaining how the fact that there is no moral sense organ does not suffice to recommend a debunking stance against morality.) Perhaps the absence of direct and relevant sensory input is still a decent warning sign of intuitions that might best be debunked. I remain neutral. My point is just that it does not yet settle the question of whether or not to debunk, and that metaphysics must still play a role in the end in providing a picture of reality to serve as an external standard of comparison, whether the cognitive system is hermetic or not. A second tempting idea is to think that there are independently known forms of defec- tive belief‐formation. Goldman himself (1979: 9) gives the following as examples of “faulty processes of belief‐formation”: “confused reasoning, wishful thinking, reliance on emotional attachment, mere hunch or guesswork, and hasty generalization.” But it is not obvious that these are uniform cognitive processes, and especially not obvious that any of these forms of belief‐formation are to be found in many of the interesting cases such as color (section 2). Color just seems directly given in sensation. Indeed, even in cases where these forms of belief-formation might be thought to apply, one can still question whether these forms of belief‐formation are in fact faulty for the given case. For instance, Plantinga (2000: 195–8) suggests, in reply to Freud, that God might have designed us to undergo wishful thinking for the purpose of getting to believe in God, in which case wishful thinking would be an epistemically proper basis for theistic belief. Likewise, while Singer (2005) and Greene (2008) argue that deontological thinking is based on non‐rational emotional responses, nichols (2014) counters that one still needs “a framework‐external specification of why the emotional processes are epistemically defective.” (nichols (2014) also points out that dismissing intuitions when emotionally laden “threatens to be a doomsday argument for normative ethics.” Indeed it might be that virtually all human cognition is emotionally laden.) 348 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS Perhaps – at least in those cases when one can assimilate the intuition to those of a generally poorly produced sort – one again finds a decent warning sign of an intuition that might best be debunked. My point is just that it does not yet settle the general question of whether or not to debunk in two respects: it does not apply to many crucial cases (for example, color), and it remains possible to allow that the intuition, while being of a gener- ally poorly produced sort, is also of a more specific well‐produced sort (for example, Plantinga’s idea that wishful thinking might be specifically proper for theistic belief). Goldman (1992: 53) also introduces the notion of an “autonomous” internal explana- tion, as the sign of when to debunk in a selective way: The [presumption against veridicality] arises only when a feeling or intuition can be given an autonomous internal explanation, where an internal explanation is autonomous if it either excludes expansion into a fuller explanation citing the metaphysical posit or is unreceptive to such expansion. A system can be autonomous in this sense without being hermetic. Indeed when the non‐ hermetic folk physics module generates intuitions solely on the basis of false assumptions about the world (for example, intuitions about curvilinear motion on the basis of impe- tus), the explanation excludes expansion into a fuller explanation citing the metaphysical posit (impetus itself), precisely because there is no such thing as impetus. Likewise if the hermetic folk mathematics module generates intuitions via a sealed‐off but reliable map of mathematical reality, the explanation positively invites expansion into a fuller explana- tion citing the metaphysical posit (mathematical facts), for instance as the facts for which there was evolutionary pressure to conform. But this shows that Goldman’s own criterion of autonomy is not itself internal to cog- nitive science, but points outwards towards the metaphysical aspect of debunking. By Goldman’s own lights, whether a cognitive explanation is receptive to a fuller explanation citing the metaphysical posit depends (inter alia) on whether the posit fits reality. This is not necessarily a criticism of Goldman for he does not explicitly deny the existence of a metaphysical aspect of debunking (he is silent on the matter). In any case I conclude that metaphysics is a required partner to cognitive science for the debunking project. Part of the task of assessing intuitions for debunking is assessing whether they fit reality. 2 Case Study: Color I have argued – albeit largely in the abstract – that metaphysics is a required partner to cognitive science for the debunking project. In what remains I focus on rendering the point concrete, by taking up cases. Goldman himself, over the arc of his 1992, 1993, 2007, and 2015, discusses a fairly wide range of cases including: • the spatial and temporal unity of objects (1987: 539–43; 1992: 62; 1993: 101–8; 2015) • temporal passage (1992: 53; 2015) • the individuation of events (2007: 12–18) Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 349 • modality and essences (1992: 55–62; 1993: 119–23; 2015) • causation (1987: 538) • morality (1987: 538; 2007: 8) • color (1992: 43, 50; 1993: 114–19; 2007: 5; 2015) • numbers (1992: 46), and • deities (1987: 543; 1992: 46; 2015). Goldman initially sees these cases as generally inviting a (1987: 539) a “revisionary metaphysics” of an anti‐realist bent, according to which (1987: 538) “certain parts of our conceptual scheme (e.g., space, time, unity, cause, moral value) are really the hand- iwork of the mind,” resulting in some form of (1992: 51) “ontological demotion” to a less realist position than naïve common sense begins from. The relevance of cognitive science is in showing how and why the naïvely realist starting point needs revisionary demotion. Goldman (2015) comes to draw a distinction between two types of case. In one type of case – which I label “projections” – Goldman takes the phenomenon at issue to lack objective reality, and the intuitions in question to be mere projections of the human mind, which – as hume (1975: 294; cf. Goldman 1987: 542) memorably said of taste – “has a productive faculty, and gilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises in a manner a new creation.” In a second type of case – which I label “relations” – Goldman takes there to be an objectively real phenom- enon but one which must be reinterpreted in a revisionist spirit, as relativized to a cogni- tive system: • Projections: no objective reality (temporal passage, morality, modality and essences, deities). • Relations: objectively real relations (color, temporal unity of objects, individuation of events). I primarily focus on the case of color, with an occasional glance at some other cases en route. I focus on color since it is a central example for Goldman and since virtually all of the general morals I want to draw can be drawn from that case. I draw three overall morals: • Whether the cognitive story supports debunking depends on the background meta- physical picture. • The detailed cognitive story is sometimes irrelevant to the debunking project. • There is no metaphysical distinction between projections and relations but rather an epistemic distinction between undermining and rebutting defeaters. The first bulleted point is the most important moral with respect to my claim about the role of metaphysics in the debunking project. But the second bulleted point makes the complementary claim that the role of cognitive science is sometimes fairly mini- mal. Sometimes one only needs the (utterly trivial) claim that our cognitive system produces these intuitions, and one needs no further details whatsoever as to how the 350 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS cognitive system does so. For as long as the cognitive system produces these intuitions, and they do not fit reality (as given by the background metaphysical picture), it already follows that the intuitions are liable to defeat and a consequent loss of evidentiary standing. 2.1 Color cognition So onto color: in his earlier presentations, Goldman (1993: 117) – drawing on Gleitman’s (1981) treatment of hue – says: “This entire picture of our internal color coding system makes it difficult to interpret our color experience, upon reflection, as anything but a highly idiosyncratic artifact of that system.” he specifically (1992: 43) picks up on meta- merism (the way in which objects with different spectral reflectance distributions can still present the same color appearance, due to the way that human color receptors respond only to cumulative features), saying: “Metamerism shows that the color divisions that humans make are arbitrary or bizarre by the standards of physics. These divisions are a product of our humanly idiosyncratic visual system.” Later, Goldman (2015)  –  drawing on Averill’s (1992) and J. Cohen’s (2004, 2009) defenses of color relationalism – focuses not on metamerism but instead on differences between the visual systems of normal humans (trichromatic) and pigeons (tetrachro- matic). he follows J. Cohen, in opting for what Cohen calls “the ecumenical policy that both sorts of visual systems are right, and that one and the same object can have more than one color property” (2004: 462). The end result is a revisionary construal of color as a relational property of a visual system. As Cohen says: “It is a consequence of this relational construal that one and the same object can be simultaneously green for your visual system and not green for the visual system of the pigeon on your window ledge” (2004: 463). Color relationalism leads Goldman to a distinction between cases calling for what I have labeled a “projectivist” treatment, and cases calling for what I am labeling a “rela- tional” treatment (with color and temporal unity coming in for the latter). The difference is supposed to be that projectivism is a form of anti‐realism about the phenomena in question, positing no objective correlate in the world; while relationalism is a form of revisionary realism about the phenomena in question, positing an objective (but relational rather than intrinsic) objective correlate in the world. obviously there is much more to be said about color cognition beyond the existence of metamerism and comparative differences with pigeons. But these are the main factors Goldman notes, and will suffice for the purpose of working through a concrete case of potential debunking. 2.2 Projections as relations I have three comments to offer on Goldman’s discussion of color, the first – and most minor of which  –  concerns the projectivist/relationalist distinction, or lack thereof. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 351 I simply do not see a real distinction here. As I have commented elsewhere, with respect to projectivist views of causation: If a causal relation between c and e is real from perspective p, is there not an objective relativ- ized fact that c causes e relative to p? But if perspectival notions can be rendered objective by relativization, then any alleged perspectival truth will come with an objective relativized counterpart. (Schaffer 2010: 848) So it seems to me that projectivism implies a certain form of relationalism, namely rela- tionalism relative to the projection. If some property or relation F is indeed projected from perspective p, there is the real objective relation of being projected as F by p. how could projectivism be true without such an objective backing? So I disagree with Goldman (2015) that there is really a “second template” in relationalism that is distinct from projectivism. If anything the relational framework seems like a more general and inclusive framework, allowing for relations to perspectives or cognitive systems, but to arbitrary other factors as well. For instance, consider the case of deities, from a projectivist perspective. If the ancient Greeks projected the wrath of Zeus upon the thunder, then there is a real relation born between the Greeks and the thunder, of being projected as the wrath of Zeus. What is the difference between that and the relational treatment of color, involving a real relation between humans and tomatoes, of being projected as red? That is not to say that there can only be a single template for all cases, but only that projections/relations do not furnish distinct templates. This is also not to say that there is no other sort of difference between these cases. Indeed I think that in the cases Goldman labels as “projections” one sees a cognitive system purporting to detect certain features of reality, which look not to feature in the best metaphysical picture; while in the cases labeled as “relations” one sees conflicting forms of cognition (either between cognizers as in the color case, or between multiple modules within a single cognizer as Goldman sees the temporal unity case), and one might doubt that either form of cognition is to be preferred. It seems to me that a relevant difference between the cases that Goldman labels as “projections” and the cases he labels “relations” is not metaphysical but rather epistemic, as between undermining and rebutting defeaters. The epistemic structure of the projec- tion cases is that the evidential force of the intuition is undermined by its failure to fit the structure of reality (as given by the background metaphysical picture). The epistemic structure of the relation cases is that the evidential force of the intuition is rebutted by the evidential force of a contrary intuition (from the other conflicting form of cognition). So it seems to me that in both cases we are looking at a demotion from the naïve claim that there is an objective feature of reality, to the claim that there is merely an objective relation that incorporates the type of cognitive system. The naïve claim is just getting debunked in slightly different ways: by being shown not to fit reality (undermining), or by being shown to conflict with another equally compelling intuition (rebutting). (note that even in the rebutting cases, metaphysics is still playing a role. For part of the rebutting story is that it would be objectionably arbitrary to favor the one intuition – for example, that produced by the human visual system – over the other – for example, that 352 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS produced by the pigeon visual system. But the idea that this is arbitrary is itself a metaphysically laden judgment, involving the idea that the background metaphysical picture offers nothing against which to uphold the human or the pigeon perspective as more fitting. nothing in cognitive science itself tells against the naïve‐realist‐cum‐pigeon‐ chauvinist, who posits real colors in the world as pigeons tend to see them, towards which humans are partly color‐blind.) 2.3 do the cognitive details matter? My second comment on Goldman’s treatment of color concerns the extent to which the detailed cognitive story (be it the story of metamerism or the comparative story of human versus pigeon color vision) is really playing a substantial role in the debunking project. As Goldman himself (1993: 114–15) notes, naïve realism about color has been in “ontological trouble” at least since Locke’s demotion of colors to the status of secondary qualities, as qualities that are merely “imputed” (1996: 54) and “no more really in [bodies], than Sickness or Pain is in Manna” (1996: 51). xvi For Locke, the ideas of color, sound, taste, and odor do not resemble their causes, and so these are the ideas of secondary qualities (unlike motion, in which the idea of motion is thought to resemble real motion, at least given the corpuscularian picture Locke operates with). What is not clear to me is exactly what (if anything) the various details of metamerism and pigeon vision are adding to the ontological troubles color faces. Was Locke’s case for demotion a failure because of his ignorance of pigeons? So long as one has a background metaphysical picture on which color is a secondary quality of some sort or other, coupled with a psychological picture on which the folk naïvely view colors as intrinsic properties “painted directly onto” the surfaces of objects, xvii isn’t the former already enough to debunk the latter? What are the various details of metamerism and pigeon vision adding vis‐à‐vis the debunking project? I take the various details of metamerism and pigeon vision to come into the story in rebutting various sophisticated attempts to defend a nonreductive realism about color. For instance, metamerism puts pressure on the idea of identifying color with spectral reflectance distributions, insofar as these map many–one onto perceived color. But of course the nonreductive realist need not think that human color vision is perfect (human cognition is generally fallible of course). So there remains room to respond to the case of metamerism by identifying color with spectral reflectance distribution (or some other natural phenomena) while taking the human visual system to be an imperfect detector of that natural phenomenon. As things stand I see no need to do any serious cognitive science whatsoever, to worry about the place of color in a physical world. The cognitive details are of course intrinsically fascinating. But from the perspective of the debunking project, it seems that the cognitive details can at most reveal just how poorly our color categorizations fit into the background picture of reality. The nonreductive realist, however, can always (plausibly) admit fallibility in cognition. The bulk of the debunking work for color thus comes through the meta- physical idea that our color categorizations fail to fit anything at all in reality. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 353 2.4 how and why metaphysics matters In contrast to the detailed cognitive story – which seems largely irrelevant with respect to debunking naïve realism about color – the background metaphysical picture does seem deeply relevant. Consider again Locke’s distinction between the primary and the secondary qualities. The reason why motion remains a primary quality but color must be demoted comes from Locke’s background corpuscularian picture of reality (via Boyle). If Locke had a background physical image of the corpuscles as themselves little colored dots, then color could have been upheld as a primary quality for Locke, in a way that would have fit naïve realism. or consider Goldman’s discussion of metamerism. Metamerism is a phenomenon on which distinct objective features (different spectral reflectance distributions, which looked gerrymandered from the perspective of the metaphysical background picture) map to a common subjective response (same color appearance). If one insisted on keeping objective intrinsic color in the background picture, one could in principle accept metamerism as either showing a multiple realizability of objective intrinsic color, or (perhaps better) showing that the human visual system is an imperfect detector of color for failing to draw some real distinctions. or consider Goldman’s discussion of the human–pigeon comparison. In this case different subjective responses map to common objective features. That is, different subjective responses between normal humans and normal pigeons map to common objective fea- tures of surfaces and light which are neutral between the human and pigeon ways of seeing things. Indeed in this case there is the somewhat tempting option of thinking of the human system as defective relative to the pigeon system.xviii (And thinking of both systems as defective relative to the decachromatic mantis shrimp.) one could be excused for think- ing that we are somewhat color‐blind compared to pigeons, in just the same way that a human monochromat or dichromat counts as “color‐blind” with respect to her trichro- matic colleagues. Goldman seems to think that it would be arbitrary or “species‐chauvin- ist” to defer to either humans or pigeons (or mantis shrimp), but that claim encodes an implicit background metaphysical picture on which nature lacks objective intrinsic color which one species might better track. I agree with that background picture but am only trying to bring it into focus and identify its role in the argument that the human–pigeon comparison supports relationalism about color rather than the view that there are objec- tive intrinsic colors, which pigeons merely happen to discern better than humans. Goldman partially acknowledges this point in passages such as the following (1992: 44): “[W]hile part of the scientific research that fuels the theory of color is essentially research in physics, another part is cognitive science.” What I am pointing out is that the research in physics is coming into the picture by supporting a certain background metaphysical picture of objective reality, as lacking joints corresponding to color cognition. It is only physics via a metaphysical interpretation that fuels the debunking project for color. Putting these last two sections together: I see little coming from the cognitive science side that contributes to the debunking project for color. The cognitive science side is giving us a picture that is perfectly compatible with naïve realism, plus the modest hypoth- esis that human color vision is highly fallible. (All realistic detector systems are at least to 354 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS some extent fallible.) What is doing the bulk of the job of debunking naïve realism is the background metaphysical picture of a colorless physical reality. Color then can only be a projection of the human mind. But all this can be argued for with just the trivial cognitive claim that our cognitive system produces these color appearances in some way or another. Putting the discussion of color together (in reverse order), I conclude, as stated earlier: • Whether the cognitive story supports debunking depends on the background meta- physical picture. • The detailed cognitive story is sometimes irrelevant to the debunking project. • There is no metaphysical distinction between projections and relations but rather an epistemic distinction between undermining and rebutting defeaters. Were color the only case to consider it would be tempting to speak of metaphysics as taking the lead role in the debunking project, and to speak of cognitive science as at best a junior partner. For cases in which cognitive science is playing a more serious role one must look elsewhere. 3 Case Studies: Temporal Passage, Spatial Unity I conclude by considering two further cases, both to see the extent to which the morals drawn from the case of color may generalize, and also to see some different issues arising including respects in which cognitive science is playing a more serious role. The cases that I think are most helpful in these respects are those of temporal passage (the feeling that time “flows”) and spatial unity (the way we treat certain collections of objects as them- selves individual wholes). 3.1 Temporal passage I turn to temporal passage, as a case which is both more controversial metaphysically, and which illustrates the importance of selective constraints on the debunking project. In his initial presentations, Goldman (1992: 52) – drawing on horwich (1987) – takes up an idea which “grants that we have a feeling of the passage of time but offers a psychological explanation of this feeling to undermine its presumed veridicality.” he comments: If this psychological explanation is correct, it shows that the feeling of temporal flow could arise from the content of experience alone, without any relevant thing actually flowing. Since the notion of such flow is problematic, the invited inference is to reject the existence of such a ‘moving now.’ (1992: 53) In his Goldman (2015) – drawing on Le Poidevin (2007) and Paul (2010b) – Goldman cites experiments in which subjects experience illusions as if an object is moving, or illu- sions as to the temporal ordering of events. he takes these experiments to illustrate the Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 355 possibility that the experience of temporal passage might itself be illusory. In the Bayesian framework Goldman uses, this all goes to showing that the probability of the evidence (felt temporal passage) is actually rather high even given anti‐realism about temporal passage. In a defeater framework, this could be taken to show that the inference from apparent temporal passage to real temporal passage is defeated by how prone we are to suffering non‐veridical illusions. All of the three points made with respect to color extend to this case. First and foremost: • Whether the cognitive story supports debunking depends on the background meta- physical picture. If one believes in temporal flow – which I do not but which is a respectable view in the field – then one will take the cognitive story to be a story about an imperfect detector. By far the most eloquent presentation of this idea is given by one of its opponents, namely Williams (1951: 465–6): The final motive for the attempt to consummate the fourth dimension of the manifold with the special perfection of passage is the vaguest but the most substantial and incorri- gible. It is simply that we find passage, that we are immediately and poignantly involved in the jerk and whoosh of process, the felt flow of one moment into the next. here is the focus of being. here is the shore whence the youngster watches the golden mornings swing toward him like serried bright breakers from the ocean of the future. here is the flood on which the oldster wakes in the night to shudder at its swollen black torrent cas- cading him into the abyss. note that (as Williams indicates by labeling this “the final motive”) there are other motives for positing real passage, including motives drawn purely from physics and not from naïve feelings of time being like a river or a burning fire or a force that through the green fuse drives the flower. Indeed a more recent and physics‐savvy defense of passage is offered by Maudlin, who concludes as follows: [I]t is a central aspect of our basic picture of the world that time passes, and that in virtue of that passage things change. And there are no good logical or scientific or philosophical arguments that cast doubt on the passage of time, and there are no impediments to repre- senting, in our present physical theories, that time passes. I draw what ought to be a most uninteresting conclusion, but one that has somehow managed to be philosophically bold: time does pass. (Maudlin 2007: 142; cf. Skow 2011) of course anyone  –  such as Maudlin  –  who believes in temporal passage as an objective intrinsic feature of reality will allow that we can suffer illusions. Again, all realistic detector systems are prone to error. So from the perspective of the believer in real passage, all that has been said are the utterly trivial claim that our cognitive system produces this sense of passage in some way or another, and the utterly unsurprising claim that the system is fallible. This could have been said of any intuitions whatso- ever, including ones that many would wish to uphold, such as that here is one hand 356 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS and here is another, and that 2 + 3 = 5 (section 2).xix So whether one comes in siding with Williams against passage or with Maudlin for passage is crucial to what one makes of the cognitive story, and whether one thinks of the cognitive system as “gilding and staining” a static manifold, or just as imperfectly detecting some real flow of the temporal river. Secondly, and already apparent in the first point: • The detailed cognitive story is sometimes irrelevant to the debunking project. After all, to the extent that our naïve belief in temporal passage is debunked, the only “information” we have psychologically is the absolutely generic information that there is some cognitive process producing the intuitions, and that it can produce error. All the “oomph” of debunking – indeed virtually the entire debate – seems to me to be taking place over the background metaphysical picture. Thirdly, and of least importance for my purposes: • There is no metaphysical distinction between projections and relations but rather an epistemic distinction between undermining and rebutting defeaters. In this case one can say that, if human agents project passage onto an objectively static and undirected manifold (as per the perspectivalism of Price 1996), then there is an objective relation of passing relative to a given projected viewpoint. If my “now” includes an apple falling off a table, then the apple is undergoing the jerk and whoosh of free‐fall relative to my current agential perspective on the manifold. The case of temporal passage holds additional interest in two respects. First of all the background metaphysical picture at issue is more controversial than with color. Few now- adays accept naïve realism for color.xx But realism about passage is considered very much of a live view. xxi The case thus illustrates – to my mind – the failure of cognitive science to go it alone on any metaphysically controversial issues. To switch to some of Goldman’s other controversial examples, consider the status of deities. In both cases, all sides may agree that our cognitive system produces certain theistic intuitions. As Bloom  –  in an article entitled “Religion is natural” – writes: one of the most interesting discoveries in the developmental psychology of religion is that the bias towards creationism appears to be cognitively natural. Four‐year‐olds insist that everything has a purpose, including things like lions (“to go to the zoo”) and clouds (“for raining”). When asked to explain why a bunch of rocks are pointy, adults prefer a physical explanation, while children choose functional answers, such as “so that animals could scratch on them when they get itchy.” (Bloom 2007: 150) The theist would presumably regard this naïve tendency of the mind as a tendency to get it right. That the mind has a tendency to these intuitions should be common ground, and cannot possibly count against the theist. If anything it counts for her, insofar as it shows that her views can claim the best fit with folk metaphysics. For atheists – such as myself – it Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 357 is the overwhelming theoretical pressure of a background naturalistic metaphysical picture that drives us to demand a debunking of these naïve intuitions.xxii Goldman (1992: 46) considers the case of the theist who invokes religious experiences rather than naïve creationist intuitions, and says: The atheist replies that there is an alternate explanation of these phenomena, one that appeals only to psychological and cultural mechanisms. If the latter explanation is more parsimoni- ous, or otherwise provides a “better explanation,” then that undermines the God hypothesis. But this is in serious danger of overgenerating. Consider again my naïve perceptual intuition that here is one hand and here is another, which I am presuming should be respected rather than debunked. Yet there is a purely psychological explanation of this belief which casts the visual system as a “debunked” generator of falsidical illusions. This is a very parsimonious explanation, insofar as it is consistent with radically mini- mal hypotheses about the external world (including the most extreme solipsism). So it really matters whether hands have a good claim to be in the background metaphysical picture. or consider the status of numbers. Again all sides should agree with the utter trivial- ity that our cognitive system produces certain numerical intuitions. Goldman (1992: 46–7) considers Chomsky’s speculation that “mathematical cognition may be a by‐ product of the language faculty” and immediately says: “If this sort of conjecture were confirmed, it could add empirical support to a subjectivist, or quasi‐subjectivist, ontol- ogy of mathematics.” This seems to me again to be at serious risk of overgenerating and “debunking” everything indiscriminately. For presumably every cognitive faculty we have is the product of some evolutionary process, whether directly or by way of a byproduct of some other selective process or just by random chance. If this is empirical support for subjectivism, then the subjectivist is on the verge of a total and unselective “victory.” So the fifth and final point emerging  –  in line with the general need for selective constraints on debunking (section 1.3) – is that the debunking project for temporal passage needs real constraints. It is not enough just to say that our cognitive system produces these intuitions, or even to say that the cognitive system in question is liable to error. For these points apply unselectively to every single cognitive output. Again I say that the test for when to debunk is internal coherence and external fit with the background metaphysical picture. Indeed, in the case of temporal passage  –  just as in the case of color  –  cognitive science seems to be at best a junior partner in debunking. The main action is in the metaphysics. 3.2 Spatial unity I move on to spatial unity, as a case which is highly controversial metaphysically, and which illustrates (for the first time) at least two respects in which cognitive science has a main role to play in the debunking project, and is more than a mere understudy to 358 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS metaphysics in this task. The case of spatial (and temporal) unity is actually the first case Goldman (1987: 541) explicitly discusses, drawing on gestalt principles of unification: I suggest that Gestalt principles underlie and shape our spatial and cross‐temporal “entification” practices, our propensity to view certain sets of spatial elements as parts of one and the same physical object and certain sets of time slices as stages of one and the same continuant. he gives the case extended discussion in his 1993 (101–8), drawing on gestalt principles as well as Spelke’s (1990) work on infant cognition, which he takes to suggest that infants have “an unlearned conception of physical bodies” (1993: 107) which is augmented between six months and two years of age with gestalt principles leading to an adult con- ception in which: We do not readily consider something as a physical body if it lacks cohesion (a pile of leaves), lacks bounds (a drop of water in a pool), or lacks continuity (a row of flashing lights). These may be considered collections of objects or parts of objects, but they are not unitary and independent objects for us. (1993: 108) Missing from Goldman’s discussion, however, is any claim about why these unity intui- tions should be debunked rather than respected. Goldman introduces gestalt principles to illustrate “the principles used by the mind to structure the world into units or unities” (1987: 539). So it may be that he is simply presupposing that objective reality lacks any principle of unity whatsoever that the principles used by the mind might fit. he may simply be presupposing a metaphysical background picture on which the gestalt princi- ples are not decent indicators of the “real facts” of restricted mereological composition, where the restriction is to pluralities that are sufficiently cohesive, continuous, and bounded. But in any case I must reiterate: • Whether the cognitive story supports debunking depends on the background meta- physical picture. Thus the central moral of this discussion remains applicable. What is interestingly different about the case of spatial unity, and makes the case more favorable to Goldman’s view than the previous cases I have discussed (color: section 2, temporal passage: section 3.1), is that cognitive science can actually be very helpful here, in two distinct respects. The first respect in which cognitive science can be helpful comes in revealing what we find intuitive in the first place. As will not surprise those familiar with the metaphysics literature on composition, there is – as Rose and Schaffer (forth- coming) put the point – “wide disagreement among metaphysicians as to what the folk intuit about mereological composition and why they do so, and no empirical discipline to the discussion.” Indeed many different metaphysical theories – from universalism (see Thomasson 2007: 183–4) to brutalism (see Markosian 1998: 211)  –  have been upheld under the banner of fit with folk intuitions. It is an empirical matter – and one that is often not obvious – what is intuitive in the first place, and on this matter cognitive science is needed. xxiii Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 359 But secondly, cognitive science may also discover subtle presuppositions of cognition. For instance, in the case of folk physics (as mentioned in section 1.3) it takes sustained empiri- cal work to reveal the extent to which our physical expectations are generated by something like an impetus theory. Likewise in the case of folk biology it takes sustained empirical work to reveal the role of essentialist assumptions. Thus Atran speaks of the folk idea of a “biological essence” as “an intrinsic… teleological agent, which physically… causes the biologically relevant parts and properties of a generic species to function and cohere ‘for the sake of ’ the generic species itself ” (1998: 550–1). In the case of mereological composition, Rose and Schaffer (forthcoming) – guided by Kelemen’s (1999) arguments for “promiscuous teleology” as a default heuristic in cogni- tion xxiv – provide an empirical argument that folk intuitions about when composition occurs are driven by teleology, via the principle: “Teleologically Restricted Composition: Composition occurs when the plurality has a purpose.” If Rose and Schaffer are right about that claim, it opens up a subtle opportunity for debunking, insofar as teleology is not an acceptable part of the background metaphysical picture but is rather – as hawthorne and nolan write: “part of a superseded, pre‐scientific muddle about how the world works” (2006: 267). So in this case the detailed cognitive story is relevant to the debunking project, in two respects: • Cognitive science can help reveal what is intuitive in the first place. • Cognitive science can reveal subtle presuppositions of our cognitive engine. of course these subtle presuppositions must still be held up to our background meta- physical picture to determine whether or not they deserve debunking. The crucial point is that cognitive science can turn up hidden aspects of our thought as additional matters to hold up against reality. And thus: • The detailed cognitive story is sometimes irrelevant but sometimes relevant to the debunking project. Cognitive science at its best gives us the folk metaphysical image, which must then be compared to the real metaphysical picture. The folk metaphysical image might have inter- nal troubles. It might be incomplete or inconsistent. But assuming that it is internally coherent (or can be refined into an internally coherent picture), there remains the ques- tion of whether there is external fit with reality. That is a metaphysical assessment. xxv 3.3 Conclusions So is cognitive science relevant to metaphysics? I agree with Goldman that the answer is yes. But I have argued – both in general, and through consideration of case studies involv- ing color, temporal passage, and spatial unity – that metaphysics is also a crucial partner within the debunking project, crucial for determining when a given intuition deserves debunking at all. Intuitions (whether in metaphysics or elsewhere) may be assessed for 360 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS internal coherence or external fit with reality. The latter is a metaphysical assessment. Thus in place of Goldman’s talk of “the relevance of cognitive science to metaphysics” I find it less misleading to speak of “the joint relevance of cognitive science and metaphysics to the wider project of debunking intuitions.” By working through these case studies I have drawn the following conclusions: • Whether the cognitive story supports debunking depends on the background meta- physical picture. • The detailed cognitive story is sometimes irrelevant to the debunking project. • There is no metaphysical distinction between projections and relations but rather an epistemic distinction between undermining and rebutting defeaters. With respect to the second bullet point, I have acknowledged that the detailed cognitive story is sometimes relevant in at least the following two respects: • Cognitive science can help adjudicate debates about what is intuitive in the first place. • Cognitive science can reveal subtle presuppositions of our cognitive engine. I have primarily traced out the following implications for thinking of the debunking project as itself a metaphysically laden project: • There is no “external vantage‐point” from which to debunk metaphysics, nor is there any prospect that cognitive science can take on the debunking project alone. • Cognitive science alone cannot provide much dialectical leverage against naïve realists. • Metaphysics is an integral part of philosophical methodology, at least as it pertains to the assessment of intuitions for debunking. And so I conclude that cognitive science and metaphysics are partners in the debunking project, and both deeply relevant to philosophical methodology.xxvi Notes i Paul (2010a: 470) has more recently defended a similar view, on which metaphysical judgments are informed by “ordinary judgments” about what causes what or what is a part of what, such that: “[o]ne role for cognitive science in ontology is to identify places where our ordinary judg- ments might not be appropriately generated, as with illusions, …” And also: “[G]iven the role of ordinary judgments in ontological modeling, we need to know if facts about our cognitive apparatus result in certain sorts of perceptual or judgmental bias.” ii of course if one thinks that intuitions are used in every intellectual inquiry, then Goldman’s liaison will apply everywhere, but it will still apply in a specific way (through intuitions). That said insofar as cognitive faculties are used in every intellectual inquiry (think of the role of perception and reasoning in science and mathematics) there is also a generalization: Cognitive science is relevant to assessing cognition, and hence relevant to all fields of inquiry. For present purposes I leave open whether intuition should count as a distinctive cognitive kind. Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS 361 iii See also Paul 2012 for the case that metaphysics has some distinctive subject matters but no distinctive methodology. As she (2012: 9) puts the claim: “Both fields [metaphysics and science] can be understood as relying on modeling to develop and defend theories, and both use a priori reasoning to infer to the best explanation and to choose between empirical equiv- alents.” She (2012: 28) concludes: “Metaphysics stands side by side with natural science as an important and legitimate developer of our conceptual schemes.” iv See Pust 2012: section 1 for a useful overview of different conceptions of intuitions. v See Williamson 2007 (esp. 210–14) for a discussion of the perils of “psychologizing the evidence,” in which we “conceive the evidence in philosophy as consisting of psychological facts, such as the fact that we believe that there are mountains in Switzerland, not the fact that there are mountains in Switzerland” (234). vi I credit this point to Jennifer nagel, from her comments on Cappelen’s book at a 2014 Central APA symposium. vii See Arico et al. 2011 (esp. section 2) for a useful overview of the psychological basis for agency attribution. viii See Pollock 1987 for a seminal treatment, and Grundmann 2011 for a useful overview of these issues. I am remaining neutral on whether there can be purely “factive” external defeaters beyond the ken of the subject, or whether the subject needs to have the belief (“doxastic” defeater), or whether it merely needs to be the case that the subject should have the belief (“normative” defeater). In the cases under discussion in the main text, I am concerned with the epistemic status of certain intuitions about the metaphysical nature of reality, for those who have all the relevant beliefs. ix Kahane (2011: 106; cf. Mason 2010) associates debunking explanations with undermining defeaters: “debunking arguments are arguments that show the causal origins of a belief to be an undermining defeater.” Though as will emerge in section 5 there are also cases with the structure of rebutting defeaters. And as nichols (personal communication) has suggested, there may even be cases of debunking which undermine any claim to prima facie justification, before issues of defeat even come into consideration. I am not presupposing that there is any deep epistemic unity to debunking. x As Cohen (1984: 282–3) points out, while internalists and externalists tend to disagree on why a given process is epistemically defective, they still tend to agree as to which processes are defective. xi Also I am not supposing that there is anything distinctive to debunking. For instance, White (2010) argues that the epistemic action in debunking derives from the more general phenomenon of disagreement. For present purposes I take no stand on the matter. xii See Korman 2009 for a similar style of self‐undermining concern against global challenges to intuition. xiii In Schaffer 2009 I argue that the background metaphysical picture is best understood as structured by the grounding relation, so I would take this to be a picture about what grounds what. But nothing in the main text requires this conception of metaphysics. Fine 2001 intro- duces, as a second primitive notion alongside grounding, the notion of in reality, regimented by a primitive “In reality” operator, and glossed (2001: 25) in terms of a “positive idea of the intrinsic structure of reality.” What I speak of the background metaphysical picture looks to correspond to the propositions that Fine would take as real. Though I am not presupposing that one needs to understand this via a new primitive operator. xiv For instance, Kaiser, McCloskey and Proffitt (1986) found that naïve subjects  –  espe- cially between 3rd and 6th grade – tended to predict that a ball emerging from a curved or spiraling tube would continue along a curving trajectory (undergoing curvilinear rather rectilinear motion), presumably due to a naïve folk physics of impetus. 362 Co G n ITI ve S CI en C e A nd Me T AP h Y SICS xv In this vein Jenkins (2005: 731) suggests that we may carry “a reliable, on‐board conceptual map of the structure of the world. And we might well be able to learn about the structure of the world by examining such a map.” She sketches an in‐principle naturalistic story as to how such a map might be nurtured or implanted by nature (2005: 735–7). xvi Indeed this idea goes back at least to democritus (Taylor 1999: 9): “By convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention color; but in reality atoms and void.” xvii of course it is a psychological claim that people are in fact naïve realists about color. See Cohen and nichols 2010 for some empirical work calling this claim into question. xviii This is J. Cohen’s (2004: 462) “defer to the pigeons” option. xix Goldman himself (2015) takes the cognitive story to show that “a reasonable metaphysician would substantially revise the likelihood of the occurrence of passage experiences conditional on anti‐realism.” But this overgeneralizes. We already know that there is some cognitive story to tell for every single case of cognition. Relatedly, Paul puts the point in term of a challenge to the denier of real temporal flow: “[W]ithout the properties of nowness and passage, we’d have no way to account for the features of our temporal experience” (2010b: 337). her answer to this challenge is that the relevant features of our temporal experience might be illusions. She is surely right about that – indeed all sides should acknowledge the possibility of illusion – but I think she has thereby missed the stronger challenge. The stronger challenge is that the fact that our temporal experience has these features (felt flow) provides decent albeit fallible evi- dence that the world has these features. The real issue is then whether this sort of evidential force might still be debunked. xx Though see Campbell 1993, Gert 2008, and Allen 2011 for various attempts to defend color primitivism, as well as Byrne and hilbert 2007 and J. Cohen 2009 (esp. 67–74) for critical responses. xxi According to Bourget and Chalmers (2014), 26.3% of philosophers favored the static B‐theory, 15.5% favored the passage‐laden A‐theory, while 58.2 % gave some other answer. Acceptance of the A‐theory was found correlated with identification with Aristotle, and tended to cluster with thinking that teletransportation was death, deontology about morality, and a rejection of switching in trolley problems. xxii In this example cognitive science is playing a role in helping determine what is intuitive in the first place. As Bloom makes explicit, it is a discovery that the cognitive bias towards creation- ism is so natural and robust (as opposed to a mere culturally local indoctrination process). xxiii Just to be explicit: I  –  along with Goldman (2015)  –  classify experimental philosophy as “a sector of cognitive science.” Indeed I think that one of the roles for experimental phi- losophy is to help adjudicate those common philosophical debates over what is intuitive in the first place. For instance, epistemologists disagree as to whether our intuitions about knowledge are sensitive to the practical stakes of the subject. Well‐designed experiments can help resolve these disagreements (see Buckwalter and Schaffer 2015). xxiv Kelemen, Rottman and Seston (2013: 1075) characterize their view as “akin to dual‐ processing models that characterize early developing intuitions as heuristics that can be increasingly overridden later in development by effortful processing, but which can never- theless persistently reemerge in cases when intuitions are favored or forced.” xxv Spatial unity is also a case in which there is no metaphysical distinction between projections and relations but rather an epistemic distinction between undermining and rebutting defeat- ers. For suppose that the visual system uses gestalt heuristics while some other module uses teleological considerations. Then one can think of unity as a projection, or as a relation to a mode of thought (a given plurality might be unified relative to gestalt considerations but not relative to teleological considerations).

There is so much in Jonathan Schaffer’s paper with which I agree that it is a bit frustrating to find so many other things for which I am chastised because I failed to say them explic- itly, or because I neglected to foreswear them. For example, I am chastised for failing to acknowledge the importance of the “background metaphysical picture.” And I stand accused of neglecting to foreswear the notion that cognitive science can “fly solo” in debunking maneuvers. Let me try to clear up possible misunderstandings and departures from otherwise large‐scale consensus. There are at least two sources of our (relatively minor) divergences. one difference is that I don’t characterize my project as one of guiding metaphysicians about when to debunk. Thus, the “selection” problem, as Schaffer terms it, doesn’t arise for me; although I am certainly focused on very nearby territory. In writing my 2015 paper I was very conscious that there is only so much one can do (successfully) in a single paper; so I didn’t aspire to cover every relevant base. There are unquestionably important episte- mological issues – which Schaffer confronts admirably – that I did not aspire to tackle in that paper. Schaffer writes: I agree with Goldman that cognitive science is relevant [to metaphysics] via the debunking project. But … I take metaphysics itself to play a crucial role alongside cognitive science within the debunking project. For a crucial part of the debunking project is selecting when to debunk, and a crucial part of selecting when to debunk is assessing whether the intuition fits reality… I prefer to say that cognitive science and metaphysics serve as partners within the wider debunking project. reply to Schaffer R e PL Y T o SC h AFF e R 367 As indicated above, I do not (usually) bill my project as a debunking project, but as something slightly different. debunking requires an evidential or epistemic threshold that the debunker needs to meet. The evidence against the selected target must attain a high enough level, but it is radically unclear just how high that level should be. I don’t know how strong the (undefeated) evidence must be to warrant the “selection” of a debunking action (or precisely what kind of “action” is in question: a doxastic act? a speech act? or what?). I therefore center my discussion on a more tractable task, viz., showing that cognitive science can contribute new relevant evidence toward the revision of metaphysical attitudes (that is, doxastic attitudes toward metaphysical theses). exactly how strong the new evidence might be, and whether or not it is defeated by other evidence – these questions are set aside for another day. In the statement of my quarry, “relevant evidence” is the label repeatedly used (in “naturalizing Metaphysics,” at any rate). Presumably, relevant evidence is obtained when an inquirer gets good reason to adjust his/her credence vis‐à‐vis a proposition, upwards or downwards. I try to show how this can happen as a result of cognitive science research, without trying to weigh in on the question of whether one’s background metaphysical theory can defeat such new evidence and thereby survive a debunking attempt. I don’t deny that background meta- physical theory has a legitimate role to play of that sort. But specifying exactly when the all‐things‐considered evidence is (epistemologically) sufficient to “select” a given target for debunking would require a full‐blown epistemology, addressing such questions as the nature and proper role of coherence, reflective‐equilibrium, and conservatism in episte- mology. There is no agreement on these matters among epistemologists, despite repeated invocation of them in discussions of philosophical methodology. This large task, there- fore, was excluded from my agenda. As Schaffer seems to suspect (or wonder), however, this does not mean that I reject all forms of “partnership” or hold that cognitive science can “fly solo”. There are at least two places that a background metaphysical theory comes into play. Schaffer spells out one of them clearly, an example in which a background metaphysical theory plays a role in drawing a conclusion from a psychological experiment. Addressing Bloom’s discussion of the hypertrophy of social cognition, Schaffer points out that the cognitive scientist assumes, as part of his/her background metaphysical theory, that the geometrical shapes depicted in a heider–Simmel movie are not agents with real goals or desires. (hence interpretations of them as such are false.) Analogously, I depict a metaphy- sician as starting out with a certain “prior probability” associated with a realist hypothesis about essences and a different prior probability associated with an anti‐realist hypothe- sis. For example, the metaphysician might have a .70 credence in the realist hypothesis and .30 credence in the anti‐realist hypothesis. Then she encounters new evidence (for example, evidence that young children are quintessentialists), and proceeds first to revise the likelihood of people believing essentialism conditional on its falsity and hence lowering her (posterior) credence for realism. Still her posterior probability for realism may remain pretty high because her original prior for it was very high. In both cases, revisionary conclusions are based partly on background metaphysical theory. In the second case, merely having the priors involves a background metaphysical theory. This illustrates how my own treatment, examined in more depth, is seen to involve 368 R e PL Y T o SC h AFF e R “partnering” between cognitive science and background theory, as opposed to cognitive science “flying solo.” I repeat that for my purposes the central question posed by Schaffer – the “binary” question of whether or not to “debunk” – need not be addressed at this juncture. As long as studies by cognitive science provide evidence that gives metaphysicians reasons to revise their credences, then a (proper) epistemic impact of cognitive science will be in place. The question of whether or not to debunk – that is, to flat‐out deny the existence of a naïvely accepted ontological posit – does not have to be the fulcrum of our enter- prise. We do not disagree about the “partnering” of cognitive science with background metaphysical theory, but we do have slightly distinct conceptions of the core question in the terrain.
