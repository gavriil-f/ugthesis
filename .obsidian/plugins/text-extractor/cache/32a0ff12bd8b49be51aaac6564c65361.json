Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over until you are told you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. In what sense, if any, is knowing something incompatible with its being merely a matter of luck that one’s belief is true? 2. EITHER (a) Is it easier to raise the epistemic standards governing assertion than it is to lower them? OR (b) ‘If the word “know” picks out different relations governed by different epistemic standards in different contexts, then it doesn’t matter whether S can truly be described as “knowing” that p in our context; all that matters is which of those epistemic standards S actually met with respect to p.’ Discuss. 3. ‘[T]estimonial injustice demotes the speaker from informant to source of information, from subject to object. This reveals the intrinsic harm of testimonial injustice as epistemic objectification: when a hearer undermines a speaker in her capacity as a giver of knowledge, the speaker is epistemically objectified.’ (FRICKER) Discuss. 4. EITHER (a) Can an externalist explain the value of having justified beliefs? OR (b) When internalists say that justification supervenes on the internal facts, what should they be understood as meaning by ‘internal facts’? 5. EITHER (a) Does a good response to scepticism have to start from premises which the sceptic would accept? OR (b) ‘I know that p; hence I know that any evidence I’ll receive in the future for not-p will be misleading.’ What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning? 6. Could one come to know that p is a law of nature merely by observing enough of its instances? 7. ‘Perceptual experience is the testimony of the senses.’ How strong is this analogy between the epistemologies of perception and testimony? A12693W1 3 TURN OVER 8. Can you learn anything by consulting others whom you know to have the same evidence as you do? 9. ‘All a priori knowledge is knowledge of conceptual truths’. Is there a defensible version of this view? 10. ‘Lois Lane knows that Superman can fly. Superman is Clark Kent. So Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent can fly.’ What, if anything, is wrong with this argument? 11. EITHER (a) ‘The B-theorist cannot account for genuine change, since according to them what’s going on in the 4-dimensional block universe is fixed for all time.’ Is this a fair objection to the B-theory? OR (b) Is it possible to change the past? Is it possible to change the future? 12. EITHER (a) ‘Persistence through time as imagined by those who disbelieve in temporal parts [resembles] a medieval tale that saints were able to practice bilocation.’ (LEWIS) Discuss. OR (b) ‘Events take up time; objects persist through it.’ How, if at all, should we explain this difference? 13. If you had decided not to come to this exam, would the laws of nature have been different, would the initial state of the universe have been different, both, or neither? 14. Can any theory of modality give a plausible account of how we could come to know modal truths? 15. ‘[T]he contrast of cause with mere conditions is an inseparable feature of all causal thinking.’ (HART AND HONORÉ) Is it? What are the consequences of your answer for the metaphysics of causation? A12693W1 4 LAST PAGE 16. EITHER (a) Call a world ‘junky’ if everything in that world is a part of something else. Are junky worlds possible? OR (b) Could two things share exactly the same parts? 17. EITHER (a) Could you survive the death of the animal with which you coincide? OR (b) If the embryo from which you came had split, giving rise to two genetically identical twins, would either of them have been you? 18. ‘Necessarily, the Carfax Tower could have been 1mm shorter. But it couldn’t have been 1mm tall.’ Explain how these two claims might be thought to be in tension with one another. Which, if either, should we reject? 19. ‘Metaphysical dependence cannot be analysed in terms of supervenience.’ Do you agree? 20. ‘No adequate theory of race should have the implication that moving countries changes one’s race.’ Discuss.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
