Gavriil Fakih Trinity 2024 Possible worlds can be identified as the various different histories that reality could have had. The actual world, in contrast, can be taken to be the history we did in fact turn out to have. I argue in favour of realism on the basis that firstly they seem to their existence seems implicit in our ordinary beliefs, but more concretely, that we seem to have an ontological, Quinean, commitment to their existence. In this regard, they, crucially, provide us with an avenue for the reduction of modality. 1\tPossible worlds It is quite common to talk of the possibility for things having gone a different way. And if things had gone indeed a different way, then the world would not have been the way it is. Such a notion is quite neatly captured by the concept of possible worlds, which are simply all the various different histories that reality could have had. The actual world refers to history we in fact turned out to have. More explicitly, it is the single unique world that supplies all the correct truth-values of propositions. Non-actual worlds meanwhile refer to any worlds other than the actual one. For example, in the actual world: Joe was elected President of the United States. But there is conceivably, however, a non-actual world wherein Joe never won the presidency. Together, the actual world and all the non-actual worlds form the set of all possible worlds, that is complete possible histories of the entire universe. There is more to this pluralist of worlds thesis. For it to be coherent, worlds must be maximal—each world gives a truth-value to each proposition. For if some world w did not give p any truth-value, then neither p nor its negation would be true at w, and, thus, the disjunction of p and not-p would not be true (contrary to the laws of logic). Worlds must also be consistent—no world furnish any proposition with more than one truth-value, else we could suppose that in w both q and its negation are true, violating noncontradiction. One final clarification. There are various strengths of possibility that may be distinguished. For example, it is objectively possible that Donald could been elected President twice in a row, but objectively impossible to travel faster than light. However, both are logically possible. That is to say they are both possible holding only fixed the nature of reality, as well as the truths of pure mathematics and laws of logic. Still, it would be logically impossible for Donald to wear a tie that is red all over and blue all over at the same time. As such, the set of possible worlds exclude (logical) impossibilia, so in no possible world is Donald wearing a tie that is red all over and blue all over. 2\tRealism about possible worlds We must accept that there is at least one possible world, namely the actual one. But we could either be realists about possible worlds, taking the view that non-actual worlds exist, or be anti-realists and deny this claim. My argument is that we should be realists. The case for realism can be made on at least two grounds; first, an argument from ordinary language which I tackle in this section, and the second, more explicit, argument from ontological commitment, which I leave to section 4. It should be uncontroversial that things could have gone differently. As I am writing this essay, I am drinking tea. But I could have been drinking coffee. In ordinary language, we also readily accept the paraphrase of this notion: there are many ways things could have gone besides the way they did. Curiously, this sentence looks like it has an existential quantification; there exist many things of a certain flavour, i.e. 'way things could have gone'. What this suggests then is that possible worlds are not so alien as their name seems to imply. In other words, possible worlds are not some metaphysically weighty theory, but simply ordinary beliefs, that we already have, by another name. Perhaps it is prudent here to identify what we should mean when we say possible worlds exist. Various realisms have of course been proposed. Perhaps the most ontologically lightweight view, so to speak, is a form of abstract realism. Abstract realism holds that these worlds are some sort of abstract entities, and so of a very different kind from our own universe. Linguistic ersatzism, as Lewis terms it, is such a kind of abstract realism, identifying worlds with sets of sentences. So a possible world in which Larry (the cat) flies, or Donald was elected to the Presidency twice in a row would be identified with a set that includes the sentences 'Larry flies' or 'Donald wins the Presidency twice in a row'. Should a view as ontologically light as this count as realism? Whilst in casual conversation, something 'existing' might mean that it is tangibly instantiated somewhere in the actual world, we should not be so narrow in our formal definitions, or else the laws of logic would not exist, nor would the necessary truth that everything coloured is extended. As such, we need not be committed to the view that these worlds exist simpliciter (as Lewis would have us think) to consider ourselves realists. Thus, even if we were to accept that non-actual worlds should be thought of as nothing more than mere sentences, or properties of the actual world à la Stalnaker (1976), it would follow that they nonetheless exist. Under such a view, the concept a possible world would exists in the sense of being a true basic concept in an account that accurately represents propositions and our attitudes towards them. 3\tThe objection from actualism Before turning to the second argument in favour of realism, we can immediately reject one sort of objection, namely the objection from actualism. Recall that the plurality of worlds thesis makes a distinction between actual and non-actual worlds. What may be objected to here is the purported incoherence of such a distinction. Is the actual world not simply a blanket term for absolutely everything in existence? And if it is, then wouldn't possible worlds and all the propositions that they make true simply be a part of actuality? Compare the following two competing theses: (A)\tEverything is actual (P)\tPossibilities are not parts of actuality, but alternatives to it On their face both seem intuitively plausible. But we can appeal to the concept of linguistic convention to distinguish the two. More precisely, we can show that only linguistic convention constrains the meaning of actuality to a certain candidate meaning, either (A) or (P). For example, when we talk of solid objects we think of objects that are truly solid, with no empty space within them. Convention supplies the defeasible constraint that things that are solid then have no empty space within them. Yet nothing is like so. We know that at the atomic level, solid objects are mostly empty space, with atoms being composed of tiny nuclei and even tinier electrons. As such, the meaning of the term 'solid' is a relation that does not satisfy this conventional constraint, so the sentence 'solid objects contain no empty space' is analytic is false. The same story can be said of actuality. 'Everything is actual' is analytic, but false. There can still exist possibilities, or possible worlds, outside of actuality. modality, whether they exist in some concrete, or we speak of them in some abstract. 4\tA Quinean commitment I have so far established one simple argument for realism from ordinary language, and defended the thesis as a whole from the actualists' objection. But this does not seem alone enough, for plenty of philosophical theories could potentially spawn out of rearrangements of ordinary language concepts alone. What is required is a more explicit argument for realism that does not just shift the burden onto the sceptic but actually commits us to the existence of possible worlds. Such an argument is given by (Lewis 1986, p. 3). It, in essence, goes as so: we ought to follow the (broadly) scientific methodology of being most confident in the theory that gives the best account of something we ought to account for. So if (1) we can use possible worlds to provide good accounts of such things (2) no rival theories provide a better overall accounts of these same things (3) therefore: we should be more confident in the theory of possible worlds than any rival theory What is being deliberately employed here is Quine's (1948) conception of ontological commitment. The argument mirrors Quine's argument for the existence of sets: wherein our strongest empirical theory, mathematical physics, quantifies over real numbers. In essence, it can be distilled to this: the intuitive aversion to accepting possible worlds is outweighed by the theory's benefits. As such, we have a it looks as though we have an ontological commitment if, indeed, the argument is sound and the principle indispensable (which it seems to be). 4.1\tModal reductionism What can be said in favour of (1), i.e. what do possible worlds help us provide good accounts for? Many philosophically interesting phenomena may be cited here, but I will focus on the most conventional: a reduction of modality. Some explications are in order. Modal facts are those facts concerning how things could, must, or could not have been. Donald could have been elected President twice in a row, but he could not have ever have worn tie that was red all over and blue all over concurrently. Contrast this with actual facts which are facts concerning how things are. There are many modal notions, i.e. those notions concerned with the truth or falsity of modal facts, the most relevant of which are possibility, like with Donald being elected twice in a row, or necessity, like the necessary falsity of Donald wearing the contradictory tie. A reduction of modality then expresses these modal in terms of some other notions—specifically, to avoid circularity, in terms of non-modal notions. A genuine analysis modality grants at least three substantial advantages (Sider 2009, pp. 184–185), On the epistemological front, it explains how we can know modal claims a priori: how can we know that Donald necessarily cannot wear a tie that is red and blue all over, or that he could have possibly been elected twice in a row, without expressing it in terms of facts about the actual world, facts that are empirically accessible? On the metaphysical front, it would first give a complete account of notions like necessity, not as ‘primitive feature[s] of reality’ (ibid, p. 185) but as facts made up of actual objects or facts. Second, it would make our metaphysics less parsimonious. A reduction of modality would reduce the total number of distinct primitive entities we must account for in when analysing reality. So how do possible worlds offer us such an account? The steps may be given as threefold. First, we must show that as long as we have one modal notion, we can define other modal notions in terms of. This is quite straightforward. As long as we have necessity, for instance, we have possibility, impossibility, contingency, and so on. To illustrate, take ‘it is necessary that φ’ as Nφ. It is possible that φ is then simply ~N~φ, it is impossible that φ is ~φ ^~N~φ and so on. Next, we need a way to express at least one of these modal terms in terms of possible worlds. This is again, very simple; a proposition is possible iff it is true in some possible worlds; a proposition is necessary iff it is true in all possible worlds. Last, we need some way to define possible worlds in non-modal terms (or else the account would be circular). Perhaps the most straightforward (maybe only), path is by employing Lewis' conception of possible worlds. Under Lewis' account, w is a possible world iff w is a maximal spatiotemporally connected whole. For concreteness: x is maximal iff every part of x is spatiotemporally related only the other parts x. x is connected iff every two parts of x are spatiotemporally related each other. Roughly, this translates to a conception of worlds as concrete entities, all of of whose parts are spatiotemporally related to each other and to nothing else. 4.2\tRival theories Whilst I have established so far that possible worlds gives us some substantive theoretic advantages—insofar as it enables a genuine reduction of modality—and the principle that we ought to be most confident in the theory that gives us the best ontological account, I have not yet shown that possible worlds beats out its rival theories. For the sake of brevity, I will only mention one possible candidate, namely Rosen’s (1990) fictionalism. Such a view is of the possible worlds species, but rather than identifying them with spatiotemporal wholes or abstract entities, it sees them instead as characters in a work of fiction. We can still describe and discuss Atticus Finch, for instance, even though we do not intend to discuss him as actually existing or real. To translate this sense of fiction into the account, we should read into any sentence P to do with possible worlds as ‘according to the fiction of possible worlds’. Thus, on fictionalism if we wanted to reduce a modal sentence , we would use P* to be its corresponding possible worlds analysis. So, if P is ‘it is possible that Donald won the Presidency twice in a row’, then P* is ‘in some possible world there are talking donkeys.’ This gets us as close analysing modality by employing possible worlds as an, albeit fictional, concept, without committing us to the explicit existence of non-actual worlds. But an arguably critical fault can be identified in the fictionalists’ story so far. It looks like the ‘according to’ is doing much of the work of reducing modality, and for the reason that it is still not clear what exactly these possible worlds are describing. The question thus is: according to what? What exactly is possible in these fictions? Does anything go? Ultimately, then even if this is to count as a genuine analysis of modality, clearly it is less preferable than the Lewisian account which is avowedly realist. 5\tConclusion We should believe that possible worlds do indeed exist. Not only does the realist thesis seem to be simply a retelling of our ordinary beliefs, but it seems as though we have an ontological commitment to their existence since they provide the best theoretical account.
