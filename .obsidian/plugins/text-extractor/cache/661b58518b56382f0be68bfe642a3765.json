Working abstract: This ‘year of elections’ has renewed global concerns of foreign interference in democracy. [1] Russian-linked disinformation campaigns are particularly blamed for sowing the distrust and fragmentation that increas- ingly characterise democratic information environments. [2] However, data on the relationship between exposure to Russian disinformation and reduced pub- lic trust in institutions remains scarce. This thesis examines how such exposure through oligarch-owned media impacts public trust in the case of Moldova, a major battleground in Russia’s ‘information war’. [3] Through textual analysis of Russian and Moldovan media outlets, it measures the narrative spread of five identified false narratives disseminated during Moldova’s 2024 electoral cycle, which included a major referendum over its European direction. Then, using a regression-based approach focussed on the effect of oligarchic ownership, it quantifies disinformation prevalence and its influence. The findings contribute to understanding how disinformation erodes trust and hold actionable insight for policymaking. 1.
