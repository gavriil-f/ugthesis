That would be almost a quarter of its expected profit for the period. It has launched an investigation headed by Deloitte, and says it is now working to establish the impact of the issue on its full-year results. \"Disappointment would be an understatement,\" said Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis. Mr Lewis, who only took the helm on 1 September, said it was \"a serious issue\", but insisted \"it doesn't take away from what I'm able to build at Tesco\". The news prompted a plunge in Tesco's share price, which closed 11.6% lower at 203p. As a result almost £2.2bn was wiped from Tesco's value on the stock market. How does information affect prices? Finance 9 Why Did The Value Of Tesco Fall So Much? Less profitable than expected Affects forecast of future cash flows Less on hand cash than expected Reduces options for future investment, which affects cash flows Corporate governance issues may be broader Fraud in one place might mean fraud elsewhere This may lead to further bad news in the future Prices reflect expectations of future value, i.e. future claims to cash flows paid out to shareholders as dividends Finance 10 Valuation Of Shares In an efficient market 𝑃𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡[𝐷𝑡+1 + 𝑃𝑡+1] 1 + 𝑟 where 𝑃𝑡 is the share price in period t is the dividend paid in period t+1 All period t+1 terms are expectations r is the required return on the asset: 𝑟 = 𝐸𝑡 𝐷𝑡+1+𝑃𝑡+1 𝑃𝑡 − 1 reflects time discounting as well as the risk of the asset and risk aversion of investors Finance 111+tD Valuation Of Shares Solving forward, obtain the dividend discount model: 𝑃𝑡 = ෍ 𝑗=1 ∞ 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+𝑗] 1 + 𝑟 𝑗 (no-arbitrage condition, i.e. there are no opportunities for arbitrage; any deviation from PV pricing leaves a sure way to make money) prices increase with expectations of future dividends prices drop with required return r (why) Finance 12 Valuing Assets / Projects Similar approach to valuation of projects Net present value 𝑃𝑉 = σ𝑗=1 𝑇 𝐸[𝐶𝐹] 1+𝑟 𝑗 𝑁𝑃𝑉 = σ𝑗=1 𝑇 𝐸[𝐶𝐹] 1+𝑟 𝑗 − 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 Finance13 Valuing Assets / Projects Other criteria also used by practitioners to assess investments Internal rate of return, IRR ෍ 𝑗=1 𝑇 𝐸[𝐶𝐹] 1 + 𝐼𝑅𝑅 𝑗 = 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 Payback period: T such that σ𝑗=1 𝑇 𝐸[𝐶𝐹] 1+𝑟 𝑗 = 𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 Graham and Harvey (2002) survey 392 CFOs: IRR and NPV quite popular (~75%) Finance14 Valuation Of Shares To evaluate 𝑃𝑡 we need Expectations of future dividends 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+𝑗] An estimate of the required rate of return, 𝑟, which we use to discount cash flows Finance 15 Valuation Of Shares To evaluate 𝑃𝑡 we need Expectations of future dividends 𝐸𝑡[𝐷𝑡+𝑗] Most work assumes rational expectations (RE) RE means that on average beliefs are correct, which means that forecast errors 𝐷𝑡+𝑗 − 𝐸𝑡 𝐷𝑡+𝑗 are not predictable at time 𝑡 In practice, means we can replace 𝐸𝑡 𝐷𝑡+𝑗 with model that best predicts 𝐷𝑡+𝑗 Look at departures from RE in Lecture 4 Finance 16 Valuation Of Shares To evaluate 𝑃𝑡 we need An estimate of the required rate of return, which we use to discount cash flows This depends on fundamental features of the asset, i.e. cash flow risk (this is measurable) It also depends on preferences of investors: risk aversion, and impatience most work focuses on this aspect Finance 17 Finding The Discount Rate Linking preferences to returns and prices Measuring impatience/risk aversion at the individual level e.g. if indifferent between £1 now and £(1+r) tomorrow, then daily discount factor is 1/(1+r) willingness to pay for risky bets yields measures of risk aversion Measuring risk aversion at the aggregate level Calibrate ”simple” investor preferences that justify market prices Use historic returns for similar firms makes sense if firm risk and investor preferences are similar but future returns may differ from past returns for several reasons Finance18 Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) We implicitly assumed that this ”price is right” reflects correct expectations and true required returns (aggregating market preferences) Formally: Efficient Market Hypothesis “actual price at every point in time represent very good estimates of intrinsic values” (Fama 1965) Market is informationally efficient with respect to information set Ω if an investor cannot make economic profits by trading on the information contained in Ω (Jensen 1978) Finance19 Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) Market efficiency means that prices are such that investors earn just the required return on average realized returns depend on dividend news, 𝑟𝑡+1 = 𝐷𝑡+1+𝑃𝑡+1 𝑃𝑡 Then assume that 𝑟𝑡= 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+1+𝑃𝑡+1] 𝑃𝑡 = 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑟𝑡 − 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 is abnormal return at 𝑡 (for now assume that 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 is constant) Finance20 Finance21 Informational Efficiency What information goes into prices, i.e. into 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+1]? different levels of information imply different levels of efficiency Weak-Form Efficiency: past abnormal returns do not predict future excess returns information in past prices is incorporated in today’s price other sources of information that are publicly available today to predict 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+1] may still predict future returns Remember Tesco? Finance22 Informational Efficiency What information goes into prices, i.e. into 𝐸[𝐷𝑡+1]? different levels of information imply different levels of efficiency Strong-Form Efficiency: All public and private information (e.g. held by management) No incentives for information acquisition if information is costly Semi-Strong Form Efficiency Assumes prices capture all publicly available information prices, accounting data, data on competitors, regulations, etc strategies based on public information produce no excess returns Finance 23 Semi-Strong Form Efficiency Assumes prices capture all publicly available information prices, accounting data, data on competitors, regulations, etc strategies based on public information produce no excess returns Is this the case? do prices adjust quickly to public information announcements? Is it not possible to consistently beat the market? Finance 24 Semi-Strong Form Efficiency Assumes prices capture all publicly available information prices, accounting data, data on competitors, regulations, etc strategies based on public information produce no excess returns Is this the case? do prices adjust quickly to public information announcements? Is it not possible to consistently beat the market? Average performance across funds does not beat the market Some managers appear to be better than others (Gruber, JF 96), but superior performance captured in fees This has valuable economic intuition Finance 25 Efficiency And Information Acquisition If market price of Tesco shares reflects all publicly available information No need to calculate the value (unless I have new information) Why bother trying to get information? (even worse for strong form) Grossman, Stiglitz (1980): arbitrageurs invest in generating information this information is partially learned by other market participants, but arbitrageurs retain higher returns In Lectures 1-3, assume all investors have full information in Lecture 4 explore departures from market efficiency Finance26 Choice Theory And Portfolio Choice Investment decision seeks to maximize investor’s utility Allocate across many investment opportunities The main complication is uncertainty of cash flows Implies riskiness of returns, and of consumption, over time how do agents measure and account for uncertainty? Next: Simple examples where investors are risk averse and risk is known Finance27 Expected Utility Suppose 2 possible payoffs from an investment (𝐼) y1 (bad(b)) and y2 (good(g)) with probabilities 𝑝 and (1 − 𝑝) respectively Expected value of outcomes: ӯ = 𝑝y1 + (1 − 𝑝)y2 Expected utility from the investment: ū = 𝑝𝑢(y1) + (1 − 𝑝)𝑢(y2) (where 𝑢 𝑥 is the utility of receiving a payoff of 𝑥) The certainty equivalent of above lottery is yc, where: ū = 𝑢(yc) Finance 28 Risk Aversion Risk premium, r = ӯ - yc Equivalent definitions of risk averse investor: utility function 𝑢 𝑥 is concave, so ū < 𝑢(ӯ) yc < ӯ r > 0 Finance 29 Portfolio Choice Suppose you want to allocate funds to assets X and Y Total investment = 1; invest w in X and 1-w in Y Asset payoffs: investing 1 in X yields 𝑅𝑥𝑔 and 𝑅𝑥𝑏 investing 1 in Y yields 𝑅𝑦𝑔 and 𝑅𝑦𝑏 Consumption from X in good state is then 𝑐𝑥𝑔 = 𝑤𝑅𝑥𝑔 generates utility of 𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑔 , similar for other payoffs Finance 30 Maximization Choose portfolio, i.e. w, to maximise expected utility 𝑝 𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑔 + 𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑏 + 𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑏 First order condition over w yields: 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑔 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑥𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑏 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑥𝑏 = 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑔 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑦𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑏 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑦𝑏 i.e.: expected marginal utility from investing in X (LHS) = expected marginal utility from investing in Y (RHS) Finance 31 Maximization Choose portfolio, i.e. w, to maximise expected utility 𝑝 𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑔 + 𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑏 + 𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑏 First order condition over w yields: 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑔 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑥𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑥𝑏 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑥𝑏 = 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑔 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑦𝑔 + 1 − 𝑝 𝜕𝑢 𝑐𝑦𝑏 𝜕𝑐 𝑅𝑦𝑏 i.e.: expected marginal utility from investing in X (LHS) = expected marginal utility from investing in Y (RHS) ➢ this approach is not operational even in this simple setting! Finance 32 Break Story Thus Far In principle, we could solve investment problem using tools from consumer theory and choice under risk But individual utility functions are hard to observe Listing states of nature (individual specific) is even harder Aggregating to obtain equilibrium prices again very hard Finance 34 Story Thus Far In principle, we could solve investment problem using tools from consumer theory and choice under risk But individual utility functions are hard to observe Listing states of nature (individual specific) is even harder Aggregating to obtain equilibrium prices again very hard Alternative: define utility in terms of statistical measures of return and risk Mean Variance Portfolio Theory captures main economic risk v return trade off while allowing for important heterogeneity in risk aversion Finance 35Finance36 Mean-Variance Framework Utility of investment with stochastic return 𝑟, with variance 𝜎2, for investor with risk aversion 𝛾 𝑈 𝑟, 𝜎 = 𝐸 𝑟 − 𝛾 2 𝜎2 E(r)  Constant utility lines Finance37 Is there a positive relationship between volatility and average returns for individual securities? Risk And Returns Of Individual Stocks Finance38 Is there a positive relationship between volatility and average returns for individual securities? Historical Volatility and Return for 500 Individual Stocks, by Size, 1926–2004 Risk And Returns Of Individual StocksThe Returns Of Individual Stocks There is no precise relationship between volatility and average returns for individual stocks Larger stocks tend to have lower volatility than smaller stocks and also exhibit smaller returns But all stocks tend to be riskier than well diversified, portfolios Finance 39Finance 40 Portfolio Theory Individual stocks are rarely held in isolation; rather they are held as elements of a portfolio. How should we combine assets in our portfolios? DIVERSIFICATION: The risk of an asset’s poor return can be offset by another asset, if returns are not too correlated Don’t put all your eggs in one basket! Portfolios With 2 Risky Assets Let 𝑟𝐴 and 𝑟𝐵 be the returns on asset A and B These are stochastic variables, with: means 𝐸 𝑟𝐴 and 𝐸 𝑟𝐵 and covariance matrix 𝜎𝐴 2 𝜎𝐴𝐵 𝜎𝐴𝐵 𝜎𝐵 2 Weights: 𝑤 = fraction of wealth in A, 1 − 𝑤 in B Portfolio returns 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝑟𝐴 + (1 − 𝑤)𝑟𝐵 Finance 41 Portfolio Expected Returns And Variance Expected return for the portfolio is: 𝐸(𝑟𝑝) = 𝑤𝐸(𝑟𝐴) + 1 − 𝑤 𝐸(𝑟𝐵) And the portfolio variance is: 𝜎𝑃 2 = 𝐸(𝑟𝑝 − 𝐸(𝑟𝑝)) 2 = 𝑤2𝜎𝐴 2 + (1 − 𝑤)2𝜎𝐵 2 + 2𝑤(1 − 𝑤)𝜎𝐴𝐵 where 𝜌𝐴𝐵 = 𝜎𝐴𝐵 𝜎𝐴𝜎𝐵 ∈ −1,1 is the correlation coefficient between 𝑟𝐴 and 𝑟𝐵 Finance 42 The Impact Of Correlation Assume means, variances and correlations are constant Consider the polar cases: Perfect positive correlation: 𝜌𝐴𝐵 = +1 Perfect negative correlation: 𝜌𝐴𝐵 = −1 No correlation: 𝜌𝐴𝐵 = 0 What does the variance of the portfolio look like? Finance 43 Perfect Positive Correlation ρ=+1 When 𝜌𝐴𝐵 = +1 we get: 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝜎𝐴 + 1 − 𝑤 𝜎𝐵 2 Or: 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝜎𝐴 + 1 − 𝑤 𝜎𝐵 risk of portfolio is the average risk of the assets (weighed by 𝑤) → no diversification Can write 𝑤 = 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 −𝜎𝐵 𝜎𝐴−𝜎𝐵 Thus, can write 𝐸 𝑟𝑝 as a function of 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 Finance 44 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝜎𝐴 + 1 − 𝑤 𝜎𝐵 and 𝐸 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝐸 𝑟𝐴 + 1 − 𝑤 𝐸 𝑟𝐵 ⇒ 𝐸 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 𝐸 𝑟𝐴 − 𝐸 𝑟𝐵 𝜎𝐴 − 𝜎𝐵 + 𝑐 Finance45 Perfect Positive Correlation ρ=1 E(rp) p A B Now 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤𝜎𝐴 − 1 − 𝑤 𝜎𝐵 ⇒ there exists a combination with zero risk 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 Finance46 Perfect Negative Correlation ρ=-1 E(rp) p A B 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤2𝜎𝐴 2 + (1 − 𝑤)2𝜎𝐵 2 + 2𝑤(1 − 𝑤)𝜎𝐴𝐵 ⇒ again 𝑠𝑡𝑑 𝑟𝑝 can be lower than min 𝜎𝐴 2, 𝜎𝐵 2 ⇒ diversification: low 𝑟𝐴 compensated by higher 𝑟𝐵 Finance47 General Case E(rp) p A B Multi-Asset Portfolios Assume we have N risky assets: 𝑟𝑖 is return on asset 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 𝑤𝑖 share of wealth allocation to asset 𝑖, with σ𝑖 𝑤𝑖 = 1 Therefore, the portfolio return is: 𝑟𝑝 = 𝑤1𝑟1 + ⋯ + 𝑤𝑁𝑟𝑁 = ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝑟𝑖 Finance 48 Multi-Asset Portfolios Therefore, the portfolio expected return is: 𝐸 𝑟𝑝 = ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝐸 𝑟𝑖 Portfolio variance depends on Variances of individual returns 𝜎𝑖 2 Correlation 𝜌𝑖𝑗 between each pair of assets 𝜎𝑝 2 = ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖 2𝜎𝑖 2 + ෍ 𝑖 ෍ 𝑗≠𝑖 𝑤𝑖𝑤𝑗𝜌𝑖𝑗𝜎𝑖𝜎𝑗 Finance 49 Mean-Variance Frontier For any target expected return 𝑟: Find the portfolio with the smallest variance min 𝑤1,⋯,𝑤𝑁 ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖 2𝜎𝑖 2 + ෍ 𝑖 ෍ 𝑗≠𝑖 𝑤𝑖𝑤𝑗𝜌𝑖𝑗𝜎𝑖𝜎𝑗 Subject to: ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖 = 1, ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟 Finance 50Finance 51 Minimum Variance Frontier E(r)  Minimum Variance Frontier Efficient frontier: maximize 𝐸(𝑟) for given 𝑠𝑡𝑑(𝑟) • cannot improve one dimension without hurting the other Finance52 Efficient Frontier With Ten Stocks Versus Three StocksPower Of Diversification In general, with wi = (1/N): Finance 53            −+      =             −+      = +=   = = = = covariance average N 1 1 variance average N 1 σ )r,cov(r 1)-N(N 1 N 1 1σ N 1 N 1 σ )r,cov(r N 1 σ N 1 σ 2 p N 1i N 1j ji N 1i 2 i 2 p N 1i N ij ji2 N 1i 2 i2 2 p Portfolio Risk In Diversified Portfolios What happens when N goes to infinity? portfolio variance → average covariance of returns Hence, when held in a portfolio some – but not all -- of the risk of a stock disappears Contribution of 𝑖 to portfolio risk is smaller than 𝑤𝑖 2𝜎𝑖 2 Finance 54      +      =      away ddiversifie becan risk that away ddiversifie becannot risk that stock theof risk total Finance55 Diversification Portfolio variance # of assets systematic risk unique risk Risks Vary In How Broadly They Affect Firms Break down the set of all possible causes of risk an investor can face into two groups: Risks that affect many/most/virtually all risky assets Systematic Risk Risks that affect only one/few risky assets Idiosyncratic Risk Total risk = Systematic Risk + Idiosyncratic Risk Finance 56 Systematic Risk Risk factors that affect the economy as a whole, all assets or at least a very large number of assets. Examples: A pandemic Political turmoil Systemic mis-valuation (bubbles / crashes) GDP growth Inflation Synonyms: market risk or non-diversifiable risk. If you want to invest in stocks, you can’t escape this risk. Finance 57 Idiosyncratic Risk Risk factors that affect only a small number of assets or even only one specific asset Examples: Supply problems regulation CEO attributes (health risks, fraud, etc) Synonyms: diversifiable or asset-specific risk manage / minimize this risk by investing in other assets Note: the difference between systematic and idiosyncratic risk is a quantitative one (i.e. a matter of degree) Finance 58 Systematic Risk Principle In efficient markets, diversification will eliminate idiosyncratic risk, but not systematic risk Because idiosyncratic risk can be eliminated at little cost (by diversifying), there should be no return for bearing it Why? Only systematic risk will be “priced” expected return on a risky asset depends only on that asset’s exposure to systematic risk this will be a key feature of our asset pricing model Finance 59 Taking Stock And Next Steps We have the efficient frontier still need to identify the best stock portfolio a difficult problem for an individual investor, optimal risky portfolio depends on their risk aversion But we have neglected the existent of a riskless asset standard deviation of a risk-free asset is zero with risk-free asset, there is a single optimal risky portfolio This 2-fund separation theorem (applies more broadly) simplifies the problem Finance 60Finance61 Efficient Frontier With Riskless Asset p E(rp) rf Finance62 Efficient Frontier With Riskless Asset p E(rp) rf Combine 𝑟𝑓 with some 𝑟𝑅, what do you get?

What determines them? CAPM is an equilibrium model of asset pricing, when many (heterogeneous) agents trade stocks Balancing demand and supply of stocks generates prices that exhibit risk-return trade-off, and other predictions the idea that only systematic risk is priced is one example We will see richer models, but they inherit CAPM’s economic logic Finance66 CAPM Assumptions Everyone has mean-variance preferences differ in risk aversion 𝛾 Everyone has same beliefs about means and variances All investors small relative to overall market - perfect competition – so all price takers One period only All investments are available No taxes, no transaction costs Borrowing and lending possible at risk-free rate Finance67 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 1 All investors hold same portfolio of risky assets It is the only one sitting on the efficient frontier (everyone agrees on this because they hold same beliefs) Finance 68 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 1 All investors hold same portfolio of risky assets It is the only one sitting on the efficient frontier (everyone agrees on this because they hold same beliefs) if one investor holds 15% of risky assets in Vodafone, so do all others Vodafone must be 15% of stock market tangency portfolio = market portfolio No need to compute optimal portfolio (if market is in equilibrium) → major simplification Finance 69 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 Optimal portfolio is the market portfolio From 2-fund theorem, any efficient portfolio has: 𝑟𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓) 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 links portfolio returns to market excess returns What is it? Finance 70 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 Optimal portfolio is the market portfolio From 2-fund theorem, any efficient portfolio has: 𝑟𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓) 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 links portfolio returns to market excess returns What is it? ask: what is the systematic risk of the portfolio? Finance 71 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 Optimal portfolio is the market portfolio From 2-fund theorem, any efficient portfolio has: 𝑟𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡(𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓) 𝛽𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 links portfolio returns to market excess returns What is it? ask: what is the systematic risk of the portfolio? market portfolio is the only source of risk therefore, systematic risk is correlation with 𝑟𝑚 Finance 72 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 Investors are indifferent to marginal changes in holdings increased returns compensated by increased systematic risk 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝜎𝑖𝜌𝑖𝑚 𝜎𝑚 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖, 𝑟𝑚) 𝜎𝑚 2 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 So expected return on asset i is 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 where 𝛽𝑖 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖,𝑟𝑚) 𝜎𝑚 2 and 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 = market risk premium Finance 73 Beta If the CAPM is correct, β captures everything relevant: expected returns, correlations and systematic risk The beta of a stock will be large if either or both of the following occurs: ρiM is large (near one), i.e.. the pattern of i’s returns is closely similar to the market σi is large relative to σM, which implies that the returns to i are much more variable than market returns Finance 74 What Have We Done? Made some (pretty large) assumptions, and obtained an equilibrium asset pricing model Everyone buys a combination of the risky market and the risk-free rate Any asset has a required return based on its beta (covariance of the asset with the market portfolio) Finance75 ( )fMifi r]E[rβr]E[r −=− M iMi M MiMi M Mi i rr       , 2 , 2 ),cov( ===","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
