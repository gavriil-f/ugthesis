Gavriil Fakih Trinity 2024 External-world scepticism holds that we cannot have any justification for our beliefs about the external world and, as such, none of our beliefs about the external world can count as knowledge. Contextualism appears to offer a potential solution to this problem, in arguing that the epistemic standards for justification vary across different epistemic contexts. I argue that this response fails as an adequate reply to the sceptic’s challenge because it misses a key feature of the sceptic’s argument: the sceptic does not claim that there is simply not enough justification for our beliefs about the external world, but that there is absolutely no justification for our beliefs whatsoever. As such, no matter how low we set the standards, we cannot have knowledge about the external world. Ultimately, I posit that contextualism, whilst not offering a good response to the sceptic, does provide us with some insight into why we have seemingly contradictory or paradoxical intuitions when it comes to different epistemic contexts. 1\tExternal-world scepticism Consider two different types of statements we could make about the external world. O statements are ordinary or everyday statements about the world that would seem to be easy to know, such as the proposition that ‘I have hands,’ for instance. H statements meanwhile may represent some sceptical hypothesis that we seem to not be able to know. This may be the proposition that ‘I am a brain in a vat’ (BIV) or that I am currently hallucinating the external world, that I am possessed by a Cartesian evil demon, or so on. Having established this, the typical argument of the external-world sceptic may go as follows. I only know O, that I have hands, if I know not H, that I am not a BIV. But I don’t know that I am not a BIV, since all my experiences (etc.) would be exactly the same if I was a BIV. This argument will then generalise to every other argument I might make about the world, yielding external-world scepticism. Such an argument may be formulised simply as follows (DeRose 1995): S1\tI know that E only if I know that ~H. S2\tI don’t know that ~H. Therefore, C\tI don’t know that E. To avoid this sceptical conclusion, it appears as though we only have two options. The first is to deny S1. But this is unattractive since this requires denying epistemic closure. If I know some proposition that p, and I know that p entails q, then I can know that q. Denying this principle appears incoherent; we would have to be committed to saying, ‘I know that I have hands, but I don’t know that I’m not a BIV, i.e. I don’t know that I’m not handless. What this yields essentially is ‘I don’t know that I have hands, but I don’t know that I have hands,’—which is problematic. A second option is to deny S2. But this is also unattractive since we cannot rule out H on the basis of experience; after all these sceptical hypotheses are constructed exactly to accommodate all possible experiences. Nor do there seem to be any a priori grounds for rejecting H. We tend to accept that knowledge requires justification, but there is no way to acquire justification that I am not a BIV. 2\tThe contextualist response Contextualists then seem to offer a plausible potential solution to the external-world sceptic, that avoids the pitfalls of the prior two routes. According to the contextualist, epistemic standards vary across contexts. This might be contrasted with the invariantist notion that holds that epistemic standards do not vary across contexts. For the contextualist then, in some contexts, such as in epistemology lectures or when debating the foundations of knowledge, the standards for justification are prohibitively high. Perhaps in these cases justification may require certainty in a belief. As such we are not justified in rejecting sceptical hypotheses. However, in most everyday life these standards are far more relaxed. For instance, consider us deciding which coffee shop in Oxford is the best to study in. We might debate how busy the place typically is, how expensive the coffee is and so on. But it would be absurd to object to the discussion on the basis that we might be BIVs, that we might be possessed by evil demons, and that we do not even know that coffee shops or even coffee exists, and so on. What we can learn from this is that, in an everyday context, justification does not seem to require certainty. We can at the very least cite the evidence of our senses, memory, the testimony of others to justify claims such as, ‘I have hands,’ or ‘Pret is not the best coffee shop to study in Oxford.’ As such, depending on the context, it seems as though I can have knowledge about the external world, contrary to what the external-world sceptic says. 3\tThe argument against contextualism It is my argument that the above contextualist response to external-world scepticism is not a good one. In short, the contextualist, in making the above argument, seems to misunderstand the structure of the external-world sceptic’s challenge. I will first begin my laying out the argument against the contextualist, and then supporting its claims. P1\tIn sceptical contexts, no claim about the external world is justified. P2\tThe argument for contextualism makes a claim about the external world. P3\tThe argument for contextualism is given in a sceptical context. Therefore, C\tAccording to contextualism, contextualism is unjustified. P1 should be uncontroversial. Contextualists, by definition, accept that there are some contexts where epistemic standards are so prohibitively high that no claims about the external world can be justified. One way to understand P2 is to rephrase contextualism. Contextualism could be said to make the claim that the meaning of the word ‘know’ varies depending on its context. We could use ‘know-O’ for ordinary contexts, and ‘know-H’ for sceptical contexts. As such, the contextualist can be understood to be asserting that ‘I know-O that I have hands’ and ‘I don’t know-H that I have hands’. But herein lies the problem. Merely lowering the standards for know-O does not get us anywhere against the sceptic. She will still reject ‘I know-O that I have hands’ on the basis of the sceptical argument. Ultimately the sceptical claim is not that I have some justification for believing that I have hands, just not enough justification to count as knowledge, but rather that I have no justification whatsoever for believing I have hands. Since none of my visual experiences, memories, or reasoning capabilities, can lend credence to the negation of the sceptical hypothesis, nor to its affirmation, we can thus have no knowledge about the external world, no matter how low we set the standards. The contextualist’s response then is incomplete. Following this it should be clear also that P3 holds, since no matter the context the sceptic’s worries still hold. Ultimately then by its own admission contextualism is self-undermining. We might have to appeal to other methods, such as Nozick’s relevant alternatives account, to answer the sceptic’s challenge. In case the argument against contextualism is yet not clear, consider making a distinction between two types of external-world sceptic, the Timid sceptic and the Bold sceptic. The Timid sceptic makes the claim that there is some justification for belief in the external world, but not enough to count as knowledge. The Bold sceptic asserts meanwhile that there is absolutely no justification for belief in the external world whatsoever. At best, contextualism answers the Timid sceptic and not the Bold sceptic, since in certain contexts, standards are low enough for our beliefs about the external world to be justified. But this misses the genuinely interesting challenge posed by Bold sceptic, who a priori asserts there can be no justification for our beliefs in the external world no matter how low we set the standards. But arguably the contextualist does not even answer the Timid sceptic, since, even if there are contexts where standards for knowledge are lowered, and even if we are to accept that some of our beliefs about the external world have some justification, this does not show that they have enough justification to meet the lower standards. 4\tContextualism’s contribution What then can be said of contextualism’s contribution to the sceptical challenge? I reckon it may not offer a good response, but it might still offer a good contribution to the scepticism debate. What the contextualist can explain is why we have seemingly contradictory intuitions in O contexts versus H contexts. Consider once again O context propositions: ‘I know where I parked my car’, ‘I know yesterday was Monday’, or ‘I know this essay is due today’. These all seem intuitively like things we can know because, as the contextualist rightly says, our experiences in these contexts generally seem to lead us in the right direction. However, consider H propositions such as, ‘my car hasn’t been stolen’, ‘the world didn’t come into existence this morning’, or ‘I am not currently in a coma hallucinating my life so far’. These are propositions that we rarely, if ever, consider, but if we do then we must recognise that we cannot ever know them with any certainty, since we would have no experiences to either prove or disprove them. Contextualism thus may provide us with a practical belief-forming guide and help explain the underlying psychology behind our seemingly contradictory intuitions. But it still nevertheless fails to provide an adequate response to the problem posed by the sceptic. 5\tConclusion Contextualism does not offer a good response to external-world scepticism. External-world scepticism makes the claim that we have no justification whatsoever for our beliefs about the external world, after all our experiences would be accommodated for in any sceptical hypothesis that is constructed. As such, simply accounting for a variance in epistemic standards across different contexts fails to provide a solution to the sceptic’s challenge. At best contextualism offers us a reason why we have different intuitions when it comes to different epistemic contexts.
