Brainy is a brain in a vat, having all the same experiences, apparent memories, etc, that you have. Like you, she believes she has hands. Intuition: her belief is justified if yours is. Intuition: Brainy’s beliefs are justified if and only if yours are. E=K: You have justification to believe P iff P is supported by the Williamson 2000, ch.9 totality of your knowledge. Reliabilism: a belief is justified iff it is formed by a reliable process. Goldman “What is Justified Belief?” Evidentialism (1) You have justification to believe p if and only if your evidence sufficiently supports p. (2) Brainy and you have the same evidence. (3) What a body of evidence supports is not a contingent matter. (C) Your beliefs are justified if and only if Brainy’s beliefs are justified. E=K rejects (2); reliabilism could be interpreted as rejecting (3) Internalism A-Facts supervene on B-Facts if you can’t ‘change’ the A-Facts without Supervenience is a weak approximation of ‘dependence’ or ‘holding in virtue of’. It’s weak e.g. because superve- nience can run both ways (it’s neither a- nor anti- symmetric) also changing the B-Facts; i.e. if possible worlds that agree on the B- Facts must always agree on the A-Facts. Assume (i) you can always know what your evidence is and (ii) what a body of evidence supports is not a contingent matter. Then we get Accessibilism: facts about what you have justification to believe supervene on facts that you can always know about. Assume (i) and (iii) you can always know what any body of evidence supports. Then we get Strong Accessibilism: you can always know We’ll come back to (iii) next time. what you have justification to believe. Knowing what you have (‘proposi- tional’) justification to believe might not be enough to know which of your be- liefs are (‘doxastically’) justified.Guidance Let a ‘Norm’ be something of the form: Believe P if and only if ϕ. What, intuitively, is wrong with the following norms? • Believe P if and only if P is true. • Believe P if and only if your experiences reliably indicate P. • Believe P if and only if the propositions you know support P. 2 Intuition: they don’t provide sufficient guidance, they don’t really tell you what to do. What does this mean? Norm can guide you only if you know what it requires of you – i.e. whether the relevant ϕ is true. The above norms can often guide you, since you often know whether ϕ obtains. Goldman 1999 But they can’t always guide you. If epistemic norms are necessary and can always guide you, Accessi- bilism is true. Epistemic Akrasia (1) We’re never justified in believing things of the form “P, but it’s an Smithies “Moore’s Paradox and the Ac- cessibility of Justification”open question whether I’m justified in believing P”. (2) If we had justification to believe something while lacking justi- Salow 2019 tries to defend externalism by finding a principled way to deny (2)fication to believe that we have such justification, we would be justified in believing a claim of that form. (JJ) So if we have justification to believe something, we have justifica- tion to believe that we have such justification. This isn’t quite Strong Accessibilism; but it’s close. And by reflecting on other similarly jarring combinations (e.g. “It’s an open question whether P, and it’s also an open question whether I’m justified in leaving P open”) we can get even closer. The Anti-luminosity Argument Accessibilism requires facts you’re always in a position to know about – i.e. facts that you can know obtain whenever they d, and can know don’t obtain whenever they don’t. Are there such facts? The best candidates seem like facts about our phenomenal lives, e.g. ‘I feel cold’, ‘I have an appearance as of something red’. But for any of these, we can imagine a sequence that (a) starts with Williamson 2000, ch.4 a case where the fact clearly obtains, (b) ends with a case where it clearly doesn’t, but (c) has adjacent cases be so similar that you cannot reliably tell which you’re in. It follows that there are cases where the claim is true which you cannot reliably distinguish from cases in which it’s false – and hence cases in which you can’t know it’s true even though it is. Is this just exploiting puzzles about vagueness? Berker 2008 says yes; Srinivasan 2013 says no Another way to put the point: maximal guidance requires that the same beliefs are justified in indistinguishable cases. But any two Williamson 2000, ch.8 actually puts the argument more like that.cases can be connected by a sequence of pairwise indistinguishable ones – so this is possible only if the same beliefs are justified in all cases.
