{"path":"Example first-class Ethics exam essay.pdf","text":"Are virtue ethicists committed to the view that those who find it easier to be good are more praiseworthy for being good? What does your answer imply about the plausibility of virtue ethics? It can sound bad to say that those who find it easy to be good are more praiseworthy than those who find it difficult to be good, given both types perform the same action. Indeed, if anything, we usually think the opposite - we do not condemn those who for various historical or psychological reasons find being moral difficult, but actively praise them for overcoming these factors and being morally good regardless. However, it looks like there might be tension between these intuitions and virtue ethics (henceforth VE). How deep does this tension run, and how much of a problem is it for virtue ethics? In this essay, I argue that virtue ethicists are not committed to the view that those who find it easier to be good are more praiseworthy, at least in any way that makes virtue ethics implausible. I begin by characterising VE, and then lay out a first pass of the praiseworthiness objection to it. Next, I argue that this praiseworthiness can be responded to. I finish with a reformulation of the objection, which I argue isn’t incorrect, but also no longer poses a threat to VE. I conclude that VE gives plausible responses to both levels of the praiseworthiness objection. VE is a normative ethical position, usually considered to be the main ethical competitor to both deontic theories like Kantianism and consequentialism. The central contention of the most popular form of VE is that many (if not all) of our general ethical concepts (right, permissibility, well-being) can be characterised in terms of a theoretically prior notion of ‘the good life’. What it is to live the good life is cashed out in terms of the kind of personality that someone living the good life has, where personality refers to a set of dispositions and character traits called virtues. So, for example, VE will hold that the right action is the one that the virtuous agent would characteristically do in a given set of circumstances - and moreover, that this fact is what makes the action right. VE is usually thought to be a two-level view. On the first, virtues consist in deep dispositions to respond in certain ways, take certain actions, think certain thoughts. So e.g. kindness is usually thought to be a virtue, and kindness involves (say) characteristically acting sympathetically toward people, treating them charitably, and being sensitive to their needs. These kinds of actions need no special motivation behind them. The kind person does not need to be kind because being kind is a virtue for their kindness to count as a virtue. On the second level, we can show that the good life is an intrinsically good thing, and that the virtues are such as they are because they make up this life. This paragraph does a good job of motivating the question—making it clear what’s at stake so that the question seems philosophically interesting. It does so by highlighting that the view specified in the prompt seems counterintuitive, and indicating that virtue ethics might turn out to be committed to it. So, the plausibility of virtue ethics seems to be at stake. This paragraph starts with a clear answer to the question, and then briefly sets out how the essay will justify that answer. This helps the orient the reader and makes things transparent. This paragraph does a good job of setting out virtue ethics, as the plan above indicates it will. It’s not perfect: there are some inaccuracies, some omissions, and some unclear elements in its presentation. But it’s nevertheless to a sufficient degree accurate and clear, and it’s set in the context of a very clear argumentative framework, so these faults don’t detract too much from the essay’s argument. Although this paragraph offers helpful elaboration (especially the illustrative example of kindness), it’s once again not as clear as it might be. For instance, it’s not clear how we’re to understand the sense in which virtue ethics is said to be a two-level view. We may now consider the objection. The objection implied by the question would maintain that VE is committed to the view that people who find it easier to be kind are going to count as more virtuous who find it hard. Ex hypothesi this is not because those who find it easier to be kind will be more likely to be kind; the question specifies that both do the same action. How can we justify this thought, then? Well, it seems perfectly natural to think that the truly virtuous agent does not find it hard to be kind. The good life is not one in which the agent constantly does things she doesn’t want to out of a sense of obligation - it seems clearly better if she does these things wholeheartedly, because she cares about others and wants to help them. Therefore, it seems more virtuous to be an agent who is kind and finds it easy to be kind, than to be an agent who is kind and finds it difficult to be kind. Under VE, though, virtue is the central ethical notion, and thus it seems natural to think that a more virtuous person will be more praiseworthy. But this seems wrong! The person who finds it easy to be virtuous might just have got lucky with their psychological disposition, or their childhood circumstances. Surely they don’t deserve praise for that? I think this objection, as specified in the question, is in one sense simply mistaken. That is, parallelling a move made by consequentialists in similar contexts, the virtue ethicist can just hold that blaming and praising are themselves actions that need to be evaluated according to the criteria that all other actions are evaluated with. Therefore, it wouldn’t follow from the fact that one has the most reason to live the good life that the person who does live the good life should be praised for doing so. We do not always proportion praise to gross aptitude level. We praise children for all kinds of things we don’t praise adults for, even (and maybe especially) if the adult can do it better. So the inference from ‘doing what is ethical’ to ‘doing what is praiseworthy’ is faulty. Specifically in the case of ‘ease of being good’, it looks like we might have very strong reasons to praise those who find it hard to be moral - namely that, by praising them, we encourage them to be moral too. It seems entirely appropriate for a virtuous agent to focus on praising and encouraging those agents to be virtuous who find it hard, without giving the same attention to the already-virtuous. It might, however, be denied that this answer deals sufficiently with the objection. After all, is the objection not about praiseworthiness, rather than praise itself? We might praise lots of things that are not particularly praiseworthy, for contingent ends. But still, the objector might press, VE is committed to the view that the character of the person who finds it easier to be good is better than the person who finds it more difficult. And thus the objection still holds. At this point though, I think the objection has lost its real force in making VE seem implausible. If the worthy part of ‘praiseworthy’ is emphasised, that just means that rather than talking about whom we This paragraph begins by orienting the reader with some helpful signposting. It then does a good job of elaborating the concern about virtue ethics that the prompt suggests. So it keeps the essay’s focus trained on the question and sets up the main argument. Again, there are some minor inaccuracies and unclear elements, but these do not detract greatly from the analysis. In this and the next paragraph, the essay sets out one possible reply to the objection. As the essay goes on to acknowledge, it isn’t a very compelling reply. This is a good way to structure the essay: begin with the weaker arguments for the essay’s conclusion, explain why they’re weak, and then move on to stronger ones. If an essay begins with the argument that clinches its conclusion, then consideration of further, weaker arguments seems pointless. So this essay’s structure is better. This paragraph is nicely signposted (“It might, however…”) and makes its compelling point clearly. The reader feels moved along in the dialectic and has a sure sense of how things stand as the essay prepares to mount its stronger argument. Now the essay gives its main argument. There are ways in which the argument is unsatisfactory. For instance, we might think that the author is misleadingly focusing on the question whether virtue should really revere or praise, we are talking about what kind of character is worthy, or valuable. On this question, VE does say that it’s better to live such that one finds it easy to be virtuous rather than such that one has to struggle to be virtuous all the time. This, though, seems perfectly natural: it is a plausible answer. VE does not say that those with miserly instincts should be condemned or punished for those instincts, but it does seem to say that their lives would be better if their instincts were otherwise. And this seems fair. In this essay, I have considered two possible formulations of an objection to VE from praiseworthiness: a formulation where praise was the focus, which I rejected; and a formulation where ‘worthiness’ was the focus, which I argued did not have unacceptable implications. (1161 words) ethics is right to say that the person who finds virtue easy is living a better life, and not enough on the question whether virtue ethicists can make sense of the idea that virtue merits praise understood as an appropriate response to some sort of effort. So the argument is far from perfect. But the argument is nevertheless philosophically sophisticated and independent-minded. This conclusion doesn’t try to say anything new, which is good. By the time we get to the conclusion, the argument should be complete, so no new material is needed. Thus, the conclusion can simply restate its answer to the question and recapitulate the argument in a very brief outline, as this one does. Because this essay shows a high standard of analysis and argument, demonstrates a good understanding of virtue ethics and the way it works, clearly and directly addresses the question, and is transparently structure and written, it merits a low first-class mark as an exam essay. With more rigorous argument, more accurate analysis and presentation, and even greater clarity, it would merit a higher first-class mark.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
