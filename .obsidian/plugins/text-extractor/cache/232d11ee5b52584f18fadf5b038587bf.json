Whilst Mill makes the case for what might seem like an appealing and logical theory of utility and welfare, I find his arguments to be unpersuasive. I will make the case that Mill’s distinction between ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ quality pleasures is both incredibly vague and ineffective. Mill’s hedonism also stumbles on the problem of non-veridical—that is perceived, but not real—experiences. Rejecting desire accounts of utility along the way, I find a pluralist concept of utility that goes beyond the narrow focus of both hedonism and desire theories to be much more reflective of the broad spectrum of human experiences, and thus far more convincing. 2\tMill’s Hedonism In Utilitarianism, Mill advocates for a hedonistic description of utility and well-being. His ‘Greatest Happiness Principle’, “holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.” He argues that happiness---which he also refers to as intended pleasure---and freedom from pain “are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things…are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.”. In Mill’s eyes, then, everything we value, and everything that impacts our well-being, is ultimately derived from the dichotomy of pleasure versus pain, and thus our actions should be judged based on this principle. A ‘good’ action is one that increases net happiness, whilst a ‘bad’ action decreases it, regardless of intention or character of the agent. This creates a binary concept of utility that I will seek to dismantle later. A common early critique of Mill’s theory of utility, however, is that it is a ‘doctrine worthy only of swine’---it degrades humans to the level of creatures that simply chase any regular old pleasure, whilst trying to minimise any sort of pain. From the surface, this seems like a valid criticism, and at first glance Mill’s theory of utility does fail to encourage any of the traditional virtues, be that the Stoic values or any other ‘noble’ qualities. However, a simple response to this problem would be to argue that this line of thinking assumes that people are not capable of any pleasures that animals are not capable of. Our higher faculties afford us pleasures that can in fact be described as noble, like philosophical thought or the company of friends and family. Nevertheless, it is not the ‘swine’ objection that I find to be a convincing rebuttal of Mill’s hedonism. 3\tMill’s distinction between ‘high’ and ‘low’ pleasures Hedonism hinges on the idea that pain and pleasure are measurable, as the theory ultimately requires you to compare the two. Utility is gained and well-being improved if pleasure minus pain gives a positive reading. Writing prior to Mill, it was Bentham who first proposed a way to measure pleasure and pain by analysing the duration and ‘intensity’ of the experience. However, this did not address the criticism that some pleasures are simply more desirable than others and Roger Crisp’s Haydn and the Oyster case illustrates this problem in Bentham’s theory. Essentially, if given the choice between being given the life of an immortal oyster who feels only, “mild sensual pleasure”, and that of a successful and popular, but very much mortal, composer, a Benthamite must pick the former, because ultimately the oyster’s pleasure will over time exceed Haydn’s. In attempting to overcome the shortfalls of Bentham’s hedonist theory, Mill differentiated between ‘high’ and ‘low’ pleasures. Haydn’s life could now be picked over the oyster, because it would be filled with much ‘higher’ level pleasures such as intellectual stimulation and other human experiences that an oyster cannot every hope to understand. This ‘quality’ parameter forms the cornerstone of Mill’s hedonic theory, as it also addresses the issue of why even if humans are deprived of all pleasures we would not wish to sink into a lower grade of existence, even if that improved our happiness. Despite, as Mill put it, “a being of higher faculties require[ing] more to make him happy [and being] capable probably of more acute suffering” the quality of our pleasures are far greater, they are of a ‘higher’ order. Whilst it may be obvious that the experience and pleasures of an oyster are incomparable to a human, the boundary can become less obvious. Compare, for example, between the pleasure experienced enjoying a drink at the pub and writing an essay on what conception of utility Utilitarians should adopt. One is very much a bodily pleasure, and the other a more intellectual pursuit. Mill attempts to formalise this distinction by suggesting the quality of two pleasures, and thus the difference in utility gained from them, can be discerned by, in essence, a majority decision by those who have experience in both. He writes that, \t “Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.” The vagueness of this ‘informed preference test’ as it is known is my first problem with Mill’s conception of utility. There can never be a precise distinction, at most an intuitive feeling that one is of higher ‘quality’ than the other. Any answer would in any case ultimately be rooted in social constructs, and not in some absolute, stripped-down, framework that Mill’s hedonic theory attempts to portray itself as describing. Indeed, Mill even offers room for these 'competent judges’ to be wrong; he requires just, “for all, if not almost all” to agree and their majority decision to be final, allowing for differences in taste. This application of a final differentiation between higher and lower quality pleasures simply ignores the subjective nature of different pleasures. Others may have very different interests, so for them writing a Philosophy essay would be a very low-quality pleasure and an unenjoyable experience, even if they have other ‘higher’ quality interests. Further, Mill’s framework fails to take into consideration the changing context for certain pleasures, even for the same individual. If I have already written ten Philosophy essays back-to-back, enjoying a drink in the pub would be far preferable and provide greater utility for most sane people than writing my eleventh there and then. In essence, it does not provide the individual agency to decide for themselves what would provide them with greater utility, rather imposing upon them from above rigid, binary answer that may not suit them, and thus provide an ineffective measure of utility. 4\tNon-veridical experiences A hurdle that virtually all hedonic theories struggle with is answering the question of whether it matters if an experience is real or not. Nozick’s famous experience machine thought experiment illustrates this issue. Suppose you were offered the choice between your current life, and having your brain plugged into a machine that will provide you with maximum pleasure, either by administering a drug or creating a new life for you. Assuming the technology is fail-proof, you cannot distinguish between this fake pleasure and the real world, and you would have no memory of entering it, would you enter it? If pleasure is ‘the good’ and plugging into the machine will mean we experience more pleasure than if we were not plugged into the machine, then surely the answer is an obvious yes. However, many would refuse, and this suggests that there is something else that provides value and utility that is not pleasure, rendering the hedonic conception of utility misguided. Similarly, it feels wrong to say that a comatose patient indistinguishably dreaming the exact same life as that of fully awake and aware person, is experiencing the same level of welfare. 4\tDesire accounts A common way to avoid the philosophical issue of these non-veridical experiences---as opposed to real, veridical experiences---is by pointing out that the patient would presumably not want to be in a coma, and thus fewer of their desires are fulfilled than the awake person. Proponents of this conception of utility claim that it is the fulfilment of desires that represents a more accurate theory of well-being and utility. Desire theorists however run into their own litany of issues. Firstly, our desires can simply overwhelm us for own good, such as in the case of addiction to drugs. There may also be some things that are good for us, even if ourselves do not desire them. Crisp provides the example of a rational and well-informed girl who is capable of success, friendship and all worldly pleasures in general, but instead she desires more than anything to spend her life counting blades of grass. To any reasonable person she is not gaining any welfare, and we can thus see how the satisfaction of desires on its own is not ‘the good’. A further issue for desire conceptions of utility is that we may not even know if our desire has been fulfilled. I may meet a stranger on a plane, and desire for them to be successful, but if we never meet again I do not know if my desire has been fulfilled; my utility clearly stays the same no matter what. 5\tPluralist accounts As opposed to the very narrow conceptions of utility that Mill’s hedonism and the desire theories provide, objective lists of ‘goods’ provide a more encompassing and convincing account of what dictates our welfare and well-being. As opposed to hedonism, for example, which stipulates there is only one ‘good’---pleasure---and its inverse, pain, pluralist accounts take into considerations multiple sources of welfare and combine them into a sort of list. These could be any sort of ‘goods’, and commonly cited ones are accomplishment, friendship, knowledge. The key with objective lists is that they avoid the pitfalls of the other two conceptions of utility that I have mentioned. A refusal to be plugged into the experience machine, for example, can be explained by the fact that you would lose out on friendship and accomplishment in your life. Further, if we take our goods to be attitude-independent, (we do not care whether the individual desires them or not), we can avoid many of the desire theory related pitfalls as well. A commonly cited objection to pluralist accounts however is if individuals are alienated from our supposed ‘goods’. A committed hermit may have no desire for friendship and may reject the proposition that socialising would improve their welfare. Ultimately some may score very highly then even if they have no scored highly in all categories, and vice versa. Nevertheless, pluralist accounts offer the most accurate conception of utility, especially when contrasted with the narrow focus of hedonism and desire theories.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
