Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. PART A. METAPHYSICS AND THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE Is Truthmaker Theory a version of the Correspondence Theory of Truth? Is the truth predicate simply a disquotational device? Is perception just the acquisition of belief? Are we ever perceptually aware of mind-independent objects? Are there arguments that establish that knowledge is indefinable? Does semantic externalism provide a good answer to scepticism? Is it possible to know that p while one justifiedly believes that one is not justified in believing that p? Assuming that scepticism about the external world is incorrect, on what basis, if any, can one know that there are other minds? Why is 'gme' not projectible? How good a guide to possibility is conceivability? Is existence a property? Is non-mereological composition intelligible? Are you a collection of temporal parts? Does McTaggart's paradox establish the unreality of time? Were you ever a foetus? Do red things resemble each other because they are red or are they red because they resemble each other? Can an effect occur before its cause? Is causation analyzable in terms of counterfactuals? Is Kripke's thesis of the necessity of origin correct? Is the world the totality of facts? What is a philosophical intuition? PART B: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 'Our statements aboutthe external world face the tribunal of experience not individually but only as a corporate body.' (QUINE) Does this show that theories cannot be refuted? Does an observation of a white dove confirm the hypothesis that all ravens are black? If not, why not? When paradigms shift, does science progress? Is falsificationism an adequate account of scientific method? Must the result of an experiment be described in a theory-neutral language if it is to decide between rival theories? Did Kuhn kill logical empiricism? Can the constructive empiricist satisfactorily distinguish observable from unobservable phenomena? What is meant by naturalized epistemology? What problems does it solve? Must the aims of science fit its means? What do thought experiments show? - END OF PAPER - LAST PAGE","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
