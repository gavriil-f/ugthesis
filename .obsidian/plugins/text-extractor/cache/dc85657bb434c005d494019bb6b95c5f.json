Gavriil Fakih Trinity 2024 Epistemic injustice can be understood to sometimes occur due to the unjust distribution of epistemic goods, if we conceive of credibility and hermeneutical resources as epistemic goods—and I reckon we should. Primarily, this can be seen with the unjust distribution of hermeneutical resources, leading to a hermeneutical injustice wherein hermeneutically marginalised groups receive intelligibility deficits. However, it can also be seen to some more tempered extent with the unjust distribution of credibility, leading to a testimonial injustice wherein systematically marginalised speakers suffer identity-prejudicial credibility deficits. Crucially, nonetheless, I argue that any account which equivocates the unjust distribution of epistemic goods with the epistemic injustice that results to be implausible. I make this case on the basis of; (1) not all identity-prejudicial credibility deficits should count as injustices, and (2) even if an unjust distribution of hermeneutical resources can (be plausibly understood to) always result in a type of epistemic injustice, this does not require that all epistemic injustices represent simply the unjust distribution of epistemic goods. As such, epistemic injustice should not be understood as the unjust distribution of an epistemic good. 1\tEpistemic injustice and epistemic goods An epistemic good could be understood simply as a social good with some epistemic property; education or information, for instance. For the purposes of this essay, however, I will narrow this conception of epistemic goods to just those goods with a distinctively epistemic nature. Thus, hereon when I talk of whether a given good ought to be classed as epistemic or not, I am talking of whether the question of its unjust distribution is distinctively epistemic in nature, and not simply incidentally epistemic in nature. The purpose of this is to narrow the discussion of epistemic goods to only those that could correspond to an epistemic injustice, which is a distinctively epistemic kind of injustice. That is to say, it is a kind of injustice in which, ‘someone is wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower’ (Fricker 2007, p. 20). As such, what concerns us is not the fact that some epistemic injustices could occur due to an unjust distribution of education, for example, but whether the unjust distribution of certain epistemic goods, of which credibility and hermeneutical resources stand as the most likely candidates, constitutes epistemic injustice. Again, these are goods that in their undue deficit or excess stand a chance at being adequately conceived as constituting a wrong against some subject qua knower. I limit myself to Fricker’s (2007) account of epistemic injustice. I do not, for instance, consider Goldman’s (1999) veritistic social epistemology on the grounds that I find it untenable. Whilst explicating in breadth my reasons for this is beyond the scope of this essay, it suffices to offer two relevant criticisms made by Coady (2010). Firstly, we ought to question whether there really is only one intrinsically valuable epistemic state, that of true belief. Secondly, it is vulnerable to criticisms analogous to those of consequentialist moral theories. Fricker’s account, meanwhile, avoids these problems. On this telling, there are two valid types of epistemic injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when a speaker suffers an identity-prejudicial credibility deficit—that is she suffers in receiving deflated credibility owing to identity prejudice in the hearer (Fricker 2007, p. 28). Hermeneutical injustice occurs when ‘some significant area of one’s social experience is obscured from collective understanding owing to some persistent and wide-ranging hermeneutical marginalisation’ (Fricker 2007, p. 154). Roughly, this can be taken to mean that the speaker suffers an ‘intelligibility deficit’ owing to their hermeneutical marginalisation. What is left is to outline what I take to be the adequate criteria required for accepting that epistemic injustice does indeed constitute an unjust distribution of an epistemic good. I posit the following: Condition\tThe occurrences of all epistemic injustices can be causally traced back to an unjust distribution of epistemic goods. As long as this condition is met can epistemic injustice could plausibly be constituted in terms of an unjust distribution of epistemic goods. It will, however, be my argument that this condition fails to hold, as (1) there exist occurrences of testimonial injustice despite a just distribution of credibility, and (2) an unjust distribution of hermeneutic resources cannot explain these cases either. Taken together, we can see that there exist some species of epistemic injustices that cannot be causally traced back to an unjust distribution of an epistemic good. 2\tEpistemic injustice as the unjust distribution of credibility? If we accept Fricker’s accounts of epistemic injustice then testimonial injustice arises from the credibility deficit afforded to a speaker on account of some identity prejudice. If we further conceive of credibility as an epistemic good, then, Coady (2017, p. 61) writes, ‘it is natural to think that testimonial injustice consists in an unjust distribution [of credibility]. After all, this parallels supposed economic injustices that may occur with an unjust distribution of wealth, for example. This seems to track Fricker’s own thinking. For Fricker, the ways in which credibility is distributed amounts to a ‘credibility economy.’ Its distribution is of course not uniform, nor should it be desirable for it to be so, since different speakers do indeed deserve different levels of credibility, at least on the basis of their sincerity or competence (Fricker 2007 p. 32). But an ethical problem arises when prejudice enters this credibility economy, since it distorts hearer’s ability to make accurate credibility judgements (ibid, pp. 35–36). What this might mean then is that the resulting credibility deficits, or indeed excesses, (owing to identity prejudices), and therefore the testimonial injustices that they amount to, can be thought of as simply undue or unjust distributions of credibility. But Fricker firmly rejects this notion. She makes two points which aim to show that credibility is not suited to a distributive model on the basis of a disanalogy between credibility and other goods. The first is that ‘there is no puzzle about the fair distribution of credibility, … the hearer’s obligation is obvious: she must match the level of credibility she attributes to her interlocutor to the evidence that he is offering the truth’ (ibid, p. 19). Second, she claims that credibility is not finite, whereas distributive goods are. Both these claims are problematic. Firstly, as Maitra (2010) explains, there is the issue that Fricker’s ‘obvious’ obligation is not so obvious at all. Do I really owe it to every speaker I come across to put aside identity-based prejudices, even if I do not want to engage with them, such as a stranger in a subway, or a pundit of a political persuasion I do not know much about? As such, it is not obvious that all identity-prejudiced credibility deficits can be considered injustices, unless we supplement Fricker’s account with a proper explanation of hearers’ obligations to speakers. In any case, there indeed persists ‘a puzzle’ with regard to just distribution of credibility here. On Fricker’s second point, as Coady (2017, pp. 62–63) makes clear, credibility is actually quite clearly finite. It would be impossible, or at least irrational, to trust every piece of testimony one comes across, more so to assign them all maximum credibility (Medina 2012, p. 62). Thus, what we are left with then is no reason not to treat credibility as a good that suits a distributive model. But if we are to treat it in such a way, could we show that a testimonial injustice always results from an unjust distribution of credibility? I think the answer is no. Recall that, after all, there remains a puzzle regarding the just distribution of credibility. Consider a hearer who judges a shifty speaker to be lying. The speaker is indeed lying but is appearing shifty on account of being overwhelmingly shy. The hearer judges them, correctly, to be insincere, but assigns them a credibility deficit on the basis of an identity-prejudice. Fricker explains such cases in terms of ‘epistemic bad luck’. As such, there the hearer is neither epistemically nor ethically culpable, and no testimonial injustice is committed. All seems well, but here comes the twist. If in fact the hearer and the speaker are a police officer and a rape victim, respectively, it seems that the police officer has intuitively committed some injustice, for they have dismissed the victim for simply being shifty. At the same time, however, the actual credibility assigned to the lying speaker is just. What can be concluded from this example then is that testimonial injustice seems to depend on more than just the unjust distribution of credibility; perhaps what is at stake, or alternatively what the interpersonal relationship between speaker and hearer is (Maitra 2010, pp. 202–204). Clearly, a great deal is at stake in the case of a rape victim and police officer, and furthermore, there seems to be some burden on the police officer (in relation to the victim) to at the very least suspend judgement until he gathers more evidence. Cases like this can also be constructed in far more abstract form. Luzzi (2016) describes two types, the first of which suffices. Imagine some group, G, that is routinely wronged as knowers. When they give a testimony p they are believed, but they are not taken to know p since they are falsely regarded to be systematically ‘Gettiered’, perhaps by some pernicious Gettier demon. In addition, assume the harm done to Gs is neither strictly cumulative, nor systematic. Thus, we have a case of a just distribution of credibility, since Gs are believed, but also of testimonial injustice, since Gs are wronged in their capacity as knowers. 3\tEpistemic injustice as the unjust distribution of hermeneutical resources? I have so far laid cases where testimonial injustice can occur despite a just distribution of credibility. This would suffice to deny the claim that testimonial injustice constitutes simply the unjust distribution of credibility. But what could be said of other candidate epistemic goods, namely hermeneutical resources? Once again, we have to overcome Fricker’s two arguments against counting hermeneutic resources as goods worthy of a distributive model. Prima facie the issue of there being no puzzle in their distribution seems plausible. We could appeal to what seems to be the very obviously correct system of ‘hermeneutic egalitarianism’ (Coady 2017, p. 65). This would hold that everyone has access to equal hermeneutic power, i.e. everyone has equal access to partake in the generation of social meanings. As such, to be marginalised on such an account would be to have less than an equal share of hermeneutical resources. But such a system quite quickly becomes problematic when faced with cases of less than admirable social groups supposedly being entitled to an equal share of generating social meanings—neo-Nazis for instance. They seem hermeneutically marginalised, as they have little effect on the social meanings of ‘Jewishness’ or ‘Islam’. What we can conclude then is that, as with credibility, the question of what a just distribution of hermeneutic resources looks like remains. On there being an infinite amount of hermeneutic resources it seems as though Fricker is once again wrong. There clearly is some great competition for them, constantly, in society. Consider, for instance, the reclamation of the word ‘queer’ by the LGBT community. The social meaning of ‘queer’ only came to be a label of pride, in part through the hermeneutic power of gay rights activists, but crucially at the expense of the hermeneutic power of those who would continue to use it in a derogatory way. What this example teaches us is that socio-political struggle over the meaning of the word ‘queer’ is, in essence, a zero-sum game. As such hermeneutic resources should be considered finite. Again, we are left with no reason to not think of hermeneutic resources in distributive terms. Unlike with credibility and testimonial injustice, however, I think there is some tentative plausibility to the equivalence between an unjust distribution of hermeneutic resources and hermeneutic injustice. Ultimately, however, this crucially does not show that all epistemic injustices result from an unjust distribution of epistemic goods, as there seems to be no airtight mechanism by which to model testimonial injustice in terms of only hermeneutic deficit. Some interrelationship can certainly be pointed out between two, but nothing concrete. Furthermore, such a position would also have to face down the question of asymmetry: why exactly is it only an unjust distribution of hermeneutic resources that can constitute an epistemic injustice, and not an equally valid epistemic good—credibility. 5\tConclusion Contrary to Fricker, I have argued that both credibility and hermeneutic resources can be seen as epistemic goods worthy of a distributive model. However, this does not mean that epistemic justice should be considered to be constituted in terms of their unjust distribution alone. There exist, after all, some species of epistemic injustices that cannot be causally traced back to an unjust distribution of an epistemic good, since (1) cases of testimonial injustice occur despite a just distribution of credibility and (2) it seems implausible that hermeneutic resources can fill this gap, so to speak.
