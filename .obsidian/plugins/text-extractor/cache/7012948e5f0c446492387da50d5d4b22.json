The psychological-continuity account of personal identity is as follows: A is identical with B iff. A bears the psychologically continuity relation to B. Psychological continuity is the ancestral of psychological connectedness: A bears the psychological continuity relation to B iff. there are persons A1…An such that A is psychologically connected to A1, Ak is psychologically connected to Ak+1, and An is psychologically connected to B. Psychological connectedness, then, is the crux of the account. What exactly psychological connectedness consists in is disputed by proponents of the account. Locke used memory as the sole criterion: A is psychologically connected with B iff. B remembers being A, or perhaps has enough memories of being A. Modern authors have proposed a variety of additional factors which contribute to psychological connectedness: having the same desires, plans, etc. For simplicity, I’ll focus on memory in this essay, though my arguments should apply to other criteria of psychological connectedness too. The argument against the account, applied to memory, is this: to say B remembers being A presupposes that B is A. If B isn’t A, B doesn’t actually remember being A, they just think they do. Hence, we cannot use memory as part of a reductive account of personal identity, since a reductive account of personal identity must be able to answer the question of whether A and B are identical without presupposing facts about whether A and B are identical. I will argue that, following Parfit, we can construe the psychological- continuity account of memory so that it’s not circular, by relying on q-memories, things which seem like memories. However in doing so we open ourselves up to a serious objection from Williams: q- memories are intuitively not enough to establish personal identity. Parfit has the resources to respond to this objection; however, it’s an open question whether, in doing so, he renders his account circular. Parfit defines a q-memory as follows. A has a q-memory of experience E iff: (1) S has a belief about E which seems like a memory-belief (2) Someone, in fact, had E (3) S’s belief about E is dependent on E in the same way as a memory-belief Now, Parfit argues, we can evaluate whether or not A q-remembers being B without appeal to the concept of personal identity. If we recast our account of personal identity in terms of q-memory instead of memory, then we avoid circularity. Certainly, criteria (1) and (2) can be understood independently of personal identity. However, the The statement in the question makes a claim about psychological connectedness and alleges that it follows from said claim that the psychological-continuity account of personal identity is circular. So the very first thing you need to do, in order to properly assess the statement in the question, is to define the psychological- continuity account, making clear in particular the role psychological connectedness plays in that account. This paragraph does that clearly, precisely and efficiently. Doing this sort of thing is often a good idea – it imposes some limits on your discussion and helps you stay focussed. Here the candidate is reconstructing the argument presented in the question, filling in the gaps, adding nuance. Notice again how efficiently the argument is laid out – no frills, just gets right to the point. This is the roadmap – a statement of the view the candidate will defend in this essay and a brief preview of how they will argue for it. Notice where it comes: almost halfway through their answer. Many people think that the roadmap has to appear at the beginning of the answer; this can work fine, but often it’s just wasted words, because the candidate hasn’t yet done the necessary ground-clearing to state their position and explain their argument in any detail, so they end up falling back on generic introductions like: “In this essay, I will argue that the psychological-continuity account is circular. I’ll first produce some arguments for this claim. I’ll then consider some objections, arguing that they fail.” etc., which doesn’t really tell the reader anything. So don’t be afraid to just get right down to it – get out your definitions, reconstruct the argument in the question, explain what the answer turns on, all that stuff, before stating your position; indeed, often it won’t be possible to properly state your position without having done that ground- clearing first. (This paragraph also has the added benefit of acting as a kind of hinge-point in the answer, clearly following example shows that criteria (1) and (2) alone are inadequate for a conception of q-memory which provides an adequate account of personal identity. Williams gives the example of a man S who wakes up one day and remembers being Guy Fawkes. The man bears no relation to Guy Fawkes, but he has all the memories Guy Fawkes had, and is able to answer questions about Fawkes’ life in surprising detail. He himself is thoroughly convinced he is Guy Fawkes. Now by criteria (1) and (2) alone, S has enough q-memories to count as being Guy Fawkes. Call Guy Fawkes in 1603 Guy1, and Guy Fawkes in 1605 Guy2. By criteria (1) and (2), S has all the same q-memories with respect to Guy1 that Guy2 has with respect to Guy1. Hence, if S isn’t identical with Guy1 on the q-memory account using only criteria (1) and (2), then Guy2 isn’t identical with Guy1. But Guy2 is identical with Guy1, so S must be. However, it really doesn’t seem like S is identical with Guy Fawkes: he’s not Guy, he’s just some guy who thinks he’s Guy! Hence, criterion (3) is crucial to the account. Criterion (3), if it is to be adequate, must distinguish between S and Guy2, such that Guy2 has q-memories of being Guy1 but S doesn’t. Now, as the case is described, (3) does do this. S’s belief about E doesn’t depend on E at all, it just came about randomly. But we can redescribe the case so that it does. A butterfly flapping its wings in Australia, so they say, can cause a hurricane in Florida. Similarly, Guy1’s experience E could, in a very roundabout way, cause it to be the case that S has the relevant belief about E. Furthermore, it could be a necessary cause, so that S’s belief about E depends causally on E. A significant amount of work then, must be done by the clause ‘in the same way as a memory-belief.’ Parfit, responding to this objection, must claim that the way in which S’s belief depends on E is not the way in which memories depend on the experiences. Hence the account of psychological connectedness depends on an account of what it is for a memory or q-memory to be transmitted ‘in the right way’ – not just any causal connection will do. Parfit doesn’t offer such an account. There might be one – but the opponent of the psychological-continuity account might claim that such an account itself will necessarily depend on personal identity. This seems like a plausible claim – whether or not A’s experience causing a belief in B is the ‘right kind of causal transmission’ to count as memory plausibly depends on whether A and B are in fact the same person. (873 words) delineating the ground-clearing part from the argumentative part.) A very nice passage here (starting from “Parfit defines a q-memory as follows…”). We have a clear statement of an attempt to define psychological connectedness in terms that don’t presuppose personal identity (with numbered conditions to make it easier to refer to them later). We then have an example designed to vividly bring out the burden being placed on condition (3) – it has to ensure that people like S don’t end up being counted as identical to Guy Fawkes. Now as I reader I know exactly what work condition (3) has to do for the account to be successful. This perfectly sets up the argument that follows. Nice demonstration of relevant knowledge from elsewhere in the course here. And now we have sharpened our target even further. A bit rushed at the end here - clearly the candidate was a bit short on time (this was their last answer). A final paragraph from the candidate just summing up what they take their argument to have established would have been nice. This essay received a mark of 75. With a bit more development at the end (for example, by considering on Parfit’s behalf a possible way of understanding the crucial concept of ‘right kind of causal dependence’ and discussing it, or arguing more systematically that no such thing is possible without presupposing the very concept being analysed), it could have crept into the 80s. Yet there’s nothing particularly flashy about it – it’s short, it only discusses one author’s view, and there’s no attempt to defend an original position. The reason it’s first- class is that it’s crystal clear, entirely focussed on defending a specific answer to the question, in thorough command of the relevant material (you can see that in how they gradually but efficiently zero in on the crux of the issue), and transparently organised, with lots of helpful signposting along the way reminding the reader what’s been established so far and what questions are still left open.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
