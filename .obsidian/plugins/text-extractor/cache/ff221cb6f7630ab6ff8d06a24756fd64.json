In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. Consumption Eﬃciency Ann (a) and Bob (b) are the sole inhabitants of an economy with 10 units of good x and 10 units of good y. Their preferences are represented by the utility functions: ua(xa, ya) = 4 5 ln xa + 1 5 ln ya, ub(xb, yb) = 1 2 ln xb + 1 2 ln yb. (a) Explain why the allocation (xa = 5, ya = 5), (xb = 5, yb = 5) does not lie on the contract curve. (b) Find values of ya and yb such that the allocation (xa = 5, ya), (xb = 5, yb) does lie on the contract curve. (c) Find the general expression for the contract curve. (d) Illustrate your answers to parts (a) to (c) in an Edgeworth box diagram. 2. Consumption Eﬃciency and Social Welfare Functions I In an exchange economy with two consumers and two goods, consumers A and B have identical well-behaved preferences represented by the utility function u = ln x + 2 ln y. In the initial allocation consumer A has (11, 3) (that is, 11 units of good x and 3 units of good y), and consumer B has (5, 9). (a) Explain why the initial allocation is not Pareto eﬃcient. Illustrate this situation using an Edgeworth box diagram. (b) Suppose that good y cannot be transferred between the consumers. Find the transfer (of good x) that would result in a Pareto eﬃcient allocation. Mark this allocation on your diagram. (c) Can the initial allocation and the allocation in part (b) be ranked using the Pareto criterion? Explain why or why not. (d) Now suppose that good y can also be transferred between the consumers. Find the allocation that would be chosen by a social planner that aimed to maximise (i) the sum of the utilities of the two consumers, (ii) the minimum of the utilities of the two consumers. Comment brieﬂy on your answers. 1 3. Consumption Eﬃciency and Social Welfare Functions II Consider an exchange economy with two consumers, a and b, and two goods, x and y. In allocation 1, consumer a gets (11, 3) (that is, 11 units of good x and 3 of good y), and consumer b gets (4, 6). Allocation 2 is obtained from allocation 1 by redistributing 6 units of good x from a to b. Moreover, suppose that: (i) Consumers a and b have identical well-behaved preferences represented by the utility function u(x, y), (ii) u(11, 3) = u(4, 6), and (iii) Allocation 2 is Pareto eﬃcient. (a) Show that allocation 1 cannot be Pareto eﬃcient. (b) Illustrate this economy using an Edgeworth box diagram, together with a diagram showing the utility possibility frontier (upf). Why is the upf downward-sloping? (c) Discuss whether, on the basis of the information provided, the two allocations can be ranked, according to (i) the Pareto Criterion, (ii) a Rawlsian social welfare function, (iii) a utilitarian social welfare function. (d) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Pareto Principle as a policy criterion? Explain brieﬂy how the information available to a social planner aﬀects the feasibility of other criteria. 4. Production Eﬃciency and Second Welfare Theorem Consider an economy with two types of good, x and y, and one consumer with utility function: u(x, y) = ln x + ln y. Initially, the economy is composed of 48 units of good x, but good x can be transformed into good y according to the production function: Y = X 1/2. (a) Describe the MRS and the MRT of this economy. (b) Show that the allocation given by x = 32 and y = 4 is eﬃcient. (c) What relative price of good x is required for this eﬃcient allocation to be part of a competitive equilibrium? Find the proﬁts from production in this equilib- rium, and verify that the consumer’s budget constraint (which includes proﬁts) is satisﬁed. (d) Illustrate using a diagram of the production possibility frontier of the economy. 2 5. Welfare Theorems Consider an economy with two goods, 1 and 2, and two consumers, a and b. The preferences of consumers are represented by the utility functions: ua(xa 1, x a 2) = 2 ln xa 1 + 3 ln xa 2 and ub(xb 1, x b 2) = 2 ln xb 1 + ln xb 2 . (a) If the economy is composed of 20 units of good 1 and 12 units of good 2, ﬁnd the set of all Pareto eﬃcient allocations. (b) Suppose that consumer a has the ownership of the 20 units of good 1, while consumer b has the ownership of the 12 units of good 2 (and none of good 1). Compute the equilibrium allocation of this private economy and then show that the allocation is Pareto eﬃcient. Were all these steps necessary to conclude that the resulting equilibrium is Pareto eﬃcient? (c) Show that the allocation (xa 1, x a 2) = (5, 6), (xb 1, x b 2) = (15, 6) is also Pareto eﬃcient. Can it be obtained as a Walrasian equilibrium of some private economy? If so, what will be the equilibrium prices of that economy? (d) A social planner would like to implement the allocation in Part (c) using lump- sum transfers but is unable to transfer good 2. How should she transfer good 1 between a and b so that her desired allocation will be part of the resulting Walrasian equilibrium? 6. A Voting Rule Consider a situation in which there are 3 voters (X, Y, Z) and 4 candidates (a, b, c, d). The strict preferences of the voters are: X Y Z best a a b . . . b b c . . . c d d worst d c a Voters award 1 point to their ﬁrst choice, 2 to their second, and so on. Candidates are socially ranked according to their total (minimal) number of points. (a) Which is the socially best candidate? Which is the social ranking of all candi- dates? (b) What if candidate d withdraws before voting takes place? Who wins if candidate c also pulls out before voting happens? (c) Which of the properties suggested by Arrow is violated by this voting scheme? (d) How can voter X manipulate the voting system to make a the socially best can- didate? 3 7. Single-Peakedness and Arrow’s Theorem Consider a situation in which there are 3 voters (X, Y, Z) and 4 candidates (a, b, c, d). The strict preferences of the voters are: X Y Z best a b d . . . b c c . . . c d b worst d a a (a) Explain brieﬂy what is meant by “preferences are single-peaked”. Describe the order of the alternatives for which the above preferences are all single-peaked (and show graphically that they are single-peaked for that order). (b) Describe the set of properties that Arrow deemed desirable for a social preference ordering. (c) Show that, when the preference domain is single-peaked and not universal, the ‘simple majority rule’ satisﬁes all these desirable properties. (d) Explain why this is not a counter-example to Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem. Essay-style Questions 1. Discuss the assumptions required for each of the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics to hold. Are these so strong that the theorems are devoid of practical rele- vance? 2. Explain carefully how the presence of increasing returns to scale aﬀects the scope of the fundamental theorems of welfare economics. 3. What are the implications of the fundamental theorems of welfare economics for the organization of an economy? 4. Explain why a Walrasian equilibrium allocation is Pareto Eﬃcient. How useful is this observation as a guide to policy? 5. How can a policy-maker determine and achieve the optimal distribution of resources when lump-sum taxation is possible? What can be done when it is not? 4 6. “Any Pareto eﬃcient allocation can be supported as a competitive equilibrium, given appropriate transfers.” Under what conditions would this statement be true? What would follow if it were? 7. Is there a trade-oﬀ between equity and eﬃciency? Why, or why not? 8. Explain why the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics may be understood as saying that the allocative (eﬃciency) role of the price mechanism can be separated from the distributive (equity) role. Explain why it would be useful if these eﬃciency and equity roles could be separated. Comment on the practical implications of these observations. 9. Is majority voting an eﬀective way to make social decisions? What are the implica- tions of using majority voting to determine the level of a publicly-provided good? 10. Is it possible to make social choices based only on individual preference orderings? 11. “It is impossible to obtain a social preference ordering of social outcomes without making interpersonal comparisons of utility.” Do you agree? 12. The university’s Student Union (SU) has asked you to advise them on the design of a voting system to elect the next SU President. Every student is eligible to vote, and it is likely that there will be many candidates. Discuss the key trade-oﬀs in voting system design, and whether there is a particular voting system that you would recommend. 5","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
