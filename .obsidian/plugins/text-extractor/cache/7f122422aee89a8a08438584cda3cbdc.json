How large does д have to be? Collude: 8 per period — 8/(1-6). Deviate: 9 today, 6 thereafter = 9 + 60/(1—4). To sustain collusion, need 8/(1 — ё) > 9 + 66/(1 — д); derivation: & >09(1-ё)+68 S 8 >9-3 — 3>1 =— 6>1/3. Thus the given strategies are mutual best responses when à > 1/3. (d) Is the equilibrium in part item: Nash equm subgame perfect? Explain. Yes. The punishment strategy in the subgame after a deviation entails playing the unique Nash equilibrium of the one-shot game in each period.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
