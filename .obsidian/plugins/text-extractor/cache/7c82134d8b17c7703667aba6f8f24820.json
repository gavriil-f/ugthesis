The Size Effect 5 o Excess return of size portfolios, 1926 - 2005 o Stocks with lower market capitalizations have higher average returns (Banz 1981) o Small stocks have higher betas, but returns too large to be explained by CAPM o Still true but weaker today Other Sources Of Return Predictability 1. The Size Effect 6 o Turns out that the return difference is concentrated in January o One explanation: tax-loss selling • taxable investors realize capital losses to get deduction in current tax year • affects small stocks more: more volatile (can have larger losses) and less liquid (selling drives prices down) o January effect weakened in recent years Other Sources Of Return Predictability 2. The Book to Market, or Value Effect 7 o Value measured by book-market ratio: • (Book Value of Equity) / (Market Value of Equity) • Alternatives: earnings-price or dividend- price ratios o Excess return of book-market portfolios, 1926 - 2005 o Stocks with high book-market ratio (“value stocks”) delivered higher returns than stocks with low ratios (“growth stocks”) Other Sources Of Return Predictability 2. The Book to Market, or Value Effect 8 o Value stocks have lower betas than growth stocks o → extra puzzling! Other Sources Of Return Predictability 2. The Book to Market, or Value Effect 9 o Possible explanation: higher returns for value stocks reflect a risk premium • BUT value outperforms growth in most years, except in boom periods (dot-com bubble & 2014-2020) • BUT value less risky than growth on usual measures (volatility, market beta) • BUT growth stocks often earn lower returns than safe Treasuries Other Sources Of Return Predictability 3. The Momentum Effect ▪ Momentum Strategy is to buy stocks that have had past high returns (and shorting stocks that have had past low returns) ▪ When the market portfolio is efficient, past returns should not predict future risk adjusted returns ▪ Instead, best performing stocks over the past six months have positive alphas over the next year ▪ Conversely, the worse performing stocks have negative alpha over the next year o Effects are large: top 10% outperforms the bottom 10% by around 100 basis points per month for the subsequent six months o Violates the weak form of EMH! 10 Other Sources Of Return Predictability 3. The Momentum Effect o Holds for many different assets (Moskowitz et al 2012) 11 Reactions 12 It’s all data-snooping It will be arbitraged away It’s all omitted risk factors It’s mispricing Explanation Details Checks Reactions 13 It’s all data-snooping It will be arbitraged away It’s all omitted risk factors It’s mispricing Try many factors on a finite sample, you may find spurious predictability (does not hold out of sample) Reduction in average anomaly return after sample period or publication of source Factors to be captured in a multifactor return model (How do we know we capture risk?)

Measure risk, risk aversion Psych. Mechanisms; Why don’t rational arbitrageurs eliminate this effect? Explanation Details Checks Implications Of Non-Zero Alphas ▪ If small stock or high book-market portfolios do have positive alphas, one can draw one of two conclusions: 1. Investors are systematically ignoring profitable opportunities o If the CAPM correctly computes risk premiums, but investors are ignoring opportunities to earn extra returns without bearing any extra risk, it is because they are unaware of them or the costs to implement the strategies are larger than the value generated by undertaking them 2. The positive-alpha trading strategies contain risk that investors are unwilling to bear and that the CAPM does not capture 15 Factor Models ▪ Consider a “single-index” decomposition: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖𝑚(𝐸 𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 o Can always decompose returns as above, for adequate choice of 𝜀𝑖𝑡 o BUT to be informative about the cross-section of stock returns, the decomposition requires more structure • structure = restrictions on residual term 𝜀𝑖𝑡 • CAPM obtains in equilibrium where 𝛼𝑖 = 𝐸 𝜀𝑖𝑡 = 0 16 factorfactor coefficient Factor Models 𝐸 𝜀𝑖𝑡 = 0, 𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝜀𝑖𝑡, 𝜀𝑗𝑡 = 0, 𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝜀𝑖𝑡, 𝑟𝑚𝑡 = 0 o After controlling for the factor, residual risks 𝜀𝑖𝑡 are uncorrelated across stocks • hence return on each stock 𝑖 is “driven by” exposure to the factor o Essentially assume that systematic risk is driven by factor o 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is stock’s specific, idiosyncratic risk • Unlike CAPM, we do not derive this from an equilibrium model 17 Key assumption: Errors are mean zero, uncorrelated across stocks and with factors Covariance Across Stocks 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖𝑡, 𝑟𝑗𝑡) = 𝐶𝑜𝑣((𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖𝑚(𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑖𝑡), (𝛼𝑗 + 𝛽𝑗𝑚(𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑗𝑡)) • Constant 𝛼𝑗, 𝑟𝑓, hence no covariation • Cov 𝜀𝑖𝑡, 𝜀𝑗𝑡 = Cov 𝜀𝑖𝑡, 𝑟𝑚𝑡 = 0 by assumption 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖𝑡, 𝑟𝑗𝑡) = 𝐶𝑜𝑣 𝛽𝑖𝑚𝑟𝑚𝑡 , 𝛽𝑗𝑚 𝑟𝑚𝑡 = 𝛽𝑖𝑚𝛽𝑗𝑚𝜎𝑚 2 18 Factor Models ▪ Given that researchers have identified a number of factors that influence the return on an asset, factor models arguably help us to see how asset prices are correlated with each other ➢ not only because of co-movement with the market but also due to these other factors 19 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Proposed by Ross (1976) ▪ Given the process that generates security returns, asset prices are derived from the process of arbitrage ▪ APT is based on the law of one price: two items that are the same cannot sell at different prices ▪ Equilibrium in asset prices exists when it is impossible for arbitrage to exist ▪ No arbitrage – cornerstone of capital market theory; violation would indicate grossest form of market irrationality 20 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Assumptions ✓Homogenous expectations ✓There exists a process generating security returns ▪ APT does not need ✓Deep theory about investor behaviour ✓Mean-Variance Analysis; pricing can be affected by influences beyond mean and variance o APT predicts a SML linking expected returns to risk, but the path it takes to the SML is quite different to CAPM 21 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Consider portfolio of 𝑁 assets indexed by 𝑖 𝑟𝑝𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛼𝑝 + 𝛽𝑝𝑚 𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 + 𝜀𝑝𝑡 o where 𝑤𝑖 are weights of individual assets in portfolio, and 𝛼𝑝 = ∑𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝛼𝑖 𝛽𝑝𝑚 = ∑𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝛽𝑖𝑚 𝜀𝑝𝑡 = ∑𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖𝜀𝑖𝑡 22 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Variance of residual 𝜀𝑝𝑡 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜀𝑝𝑡) = ∑𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑤𝑖 2 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜀𝑖𝑡) o Shrinks fast with N provided no single weight 𝑤𝑖 is large → diversification o Simplest case: portfolio with N equally weighted assets, 𝑤𝑖 = 1 𝑁 All stocks have same idiosyncratic variance 𝑉𝑎𝑟 𝜀𝑖𝑡 = 𝜎2 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝜀𝑝𝑡) = 𝜎2 𝑁 23 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Well-diversified portfolio o has enough stocks, with a small enough weight in each one o residual risk has negligible variance Var 𝜀𝑝𝑡 , meaning 𝜀𝑝𝑡 can be neglected ▪ Portfolio returns are thus 𝑟𝑝𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛼𝑝 + 𝛽𝑝𝑚(𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) o BUT then we must have 𝛼𝑝 = 0 , otherwise there is a pure arbitrage opportunity 24 Arbitrage Pricing Theory ▪ Pure arbitrage opportunity o Suppose 𝛼𝑝 ≠ 0 • short 𝛽𝑝𝑚 units of the market and long one unit of the portfolio • fund both positions with riskless borrowing and lending • this gives a riskless exact return of 𝛼𝑝 o Idea: the exact same portfolio returns can be reproduced with 𝛼𝑝 = 0 ▪ Individual assets: o If 𝛼𝑝 ∼ 0 for all well-diversified portfolios, then “almost all” individual assets have 𝛼𝑖 very close to 0, a few assets can be mispriced and have nonzero 𝛼𝑖 • If sufficiently many assets are mispriced, they can be grouped into a well diversified portfolio and create an arbitrage opportunity 25 APT and CAPM 26 𝑟𝑝𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛽𝑝𝑚(𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖(𝐸 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓)Result Systematic risk captured by factors, with residual risks uncorrelated across stocks Absence of arbitrage Equilibrium of demand and supply of assets, given mean-variance prefs and rational expectations Key assumptions APT CAPM APT and CAPM 27 𝑟𝑝𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛽𝑝𝑚(𝑟𝑚𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖(𝐸 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓)Result Equilibrium of demand and supply of assets, clarifies the risk-return trade off with diversification, explains why only systematic risk matters Pros It is not an equilibrium model, rather a description of data. Why is systematic risk captured by factors? What are those factors? Does not match the evidence well, implementation issuesCons APT CAPM generalises to multiple factors → matches data better Robust to CAPM assumptions: non- financial assets, homogeneity of expectations, zero mispricing, etc Multifactor Models ▪ Generalize to a Multifactor Model o K portfolios capturing the common influence of K sources of risk 𝑟𝑖𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛼𝑖 + Σ𝑘=1 𝐾 𝛽𝑖𝑘(𝑟𝑘𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 o Prediction is (again) that 𝛼𝑖= 0 for almost all stocks o This is restrictive if K << N 28 Key assumption: Residuals are uncorrelated across stocks Multifactor Models ▪ In practice, no single factor accounts for all the correlations among individual stocks: 29 What might be some factors that drive correlations among stocks? Multifactor Models ▪ In practice, no single factor accounts for all the correlations among individual stocks: 30 There are common industry effects Leveraged companies are sensitive to interest rates Value stocks seem to move together Cyclical companies are sensitive to industrial production … Multifactor Models ▪ How do we pick the factors for a multifactor model? o First factor is (almost always) the return on a broad market index o Use variance-covariance matrix of asset returns to extract most important common factors • however, the number of such factors increases with the number of stocks • recall that the theory is useful only if K << N o Use our economic intuition to identify these factors • factors investors ought to care about or seem to care about ▪ Gap in our analysis: need theory to explain which factors should arise 31 Multifactor Models 32 Factors we ought to care about Factors investors seem to care about ??? ??? Multifactor Models 33 • macroeconomic factors • inflation, GDP growth • trade shocks • factors related to changing investment opportunities • riskless interest rate • credit spreads • Portfolios with common characteristics known to be linked to average returns (size, value, etc.) • Fama-French 3-factor model: • market, • small minus big firms (SMB), • high minus low book-market firms (HML) • 4th factor: momentum (MOM) Factors we ought to care about Factors investors seem to care about Four Factor Returns 34 1926-2013 1990-2013 Commonly Selected Factors ▪ Currently the most popular choice for the multifactor models use the excess return of the market, SMB, HML, and PR1YR portfolios o Fama-French-Carhart (FFC) Factor Specification o Fama-French (FF) Factor Specification 35 Commonly Selected Factors ▪ FF and FFC are widely used, but dispute about whether it is a significant improvement over the CAPM ➢ Claim to “explain” 90% of diversified portfolios returns, compared to 70% with the CAPM ➢ 2015: FF extended the model with 2 factors based on profitability and investment. For US data, adding these made the HML factor redundant ➢ FF and FFC used extensively in event studies in academic papers, although CAPM also used ➢ But this is an empirical model – no underlying theory – and no guarantee that the future will be like the past You can find more details on Ken French’s website: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html 36 SDF Approach ▪ Recall the dividend discount factor: 𝑃𝑖 = 𝐸[𝑋𝑖] 1 + 𝑟 where 𝑋𝑖 is the stochastic payoff tomorrow ▪ In general, different payoffs 𝑋𝑖 are discounted at different rates 𝑃𝑖 = 𝐸[𝑀𝑋𝑖] where M is the stochastic discount factor o discount more (less) states with low (high) marginal utility 37 Connection: SDF & CAPM ▪ Divide by the price of the asset 1 = 𝐸 𝑀𝑋𝑖 𝑃𝑖 = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑖) ▪ Holds for all assets, including risk-free asset and market portfolio 1 = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑖) = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑓) = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑚) o 𝑟𝑖, 𝑟𝑓 , 𝑟𝑚 are all related through the SDF ▪ Result: if SDF is 𝑀 = 𝑎 − 𝑏𝑟𝑚 then CAPM beta equation holds 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛽𝑖𝐸 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 38 Connection: SDF & CAPM 1 = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑖) = 𝐸 𝑀(1 + 𝑟𝑓) ▪ Subtracting the two sides, we have: { } 0 = 𝐸 𝑀(𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓) = 𝐸 𝑀 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 + 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑀, 𝑟𝑖) This implies: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = −𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑀, 𝑟𝑖) 𝐸 𝑀 The return of an asset depends negatively on its covariance with SDF 39 Connection: SDF & CAPM ▪ Plug in the assumption 𝑀 = 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝑟𝑚 to get 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝑏 ∗ 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑚, 𝑟𝑖) 𝐸 𝑀 o Assumption on M ensures asset return depends on covariance with market portfolio ▪ Rewrite: reward-risk ratio is the same for all assets 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑚, 𝑟𝑖) = 𝑏 𝐸 𝑀 40 Connection: SDF & CAPM ▪ Equate reward-risk ratio for asset i and the market portfolio m: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑚, 𝑟𝑖) = 𝐸 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 𝑉𝑎𝑟 (𝑟𝑚) ▪ Rewriting this gives the CAPM pricing relation: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛽𝑖 𝐸 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 41 SDF Interpretation ▪ To get a positive excess return on the market, the relation between the SDF and the market return needs to be negative ▪ SDF is proportional to marginal utility ▪ Third way to derive the CAPM beta pricing equation o CAPM follows from the assumption that investors’ marginal utility declines linearly when the market goes up → investors care about market risk 42 Key assumption: SDF is linear in the market return SDF Interpretation ▪ Fama-French model: SDF linear in market return, SMB return, HML return ▪ But why should these returns correlate with investors’ marginal utility? ▪ SMB: may correlate with missing components of wealth o moves with the returns on private businesses, which are mostly small firms {Next lecture: behavioural drivers of multifactor models} 43 Key assumption for multifactor model: SDF is linear function of K portfolio returns Aggregate Stock Market o Previous discussions: understanding the differences in average returns across stocks ▪ What about the aggregate returns? o returns on a broad market index e.g. S& P500 o puzzles emerge about the level and variance of returns 1. Equity Premium Puzzle 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle 44 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ Equities are riskier than bonds: o Std deviation(S&P) = 20% o Std deviation(T-bills) = 4% o Mehra & Prescott (1985) →Equities should command higher returns o How much higher? o Depends on risk aversion o A is Arrow-Pratt coefficient of ARA 45 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ Return earned by a risky security in excess of that earned by a relatively risk-free T-bill is an order of magnitude greater than can be explained by risk aversion! 46 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ Furthermore, Consumption-CAPM suggests: 𝐸 𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 = 𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑠 − 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠, 𝑀) where M is SDF (marginal utility of consumption) 𝐸 𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠 − 𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑠 = −𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑠, 𝑀) o Equity premium is high when stock returns & marginal utility highly negatively correlated • e.g. high premium for stocks with low returns in periods of low consumption o BUT consumption varies very little! 47 equity premium 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ US equities ▪ In terms of terminal value, if you invested $1 in stocks and bonds • From 1802-1997, your real return would be $558,945 and $276 • From 1926-2000, your real return would be $266.47 and $1.71 48 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ Is the US an outlier? ➢ Survivorship bias (many stock markets have had major interruptions – either due to revolutions, wars or hyperinflation) and the time series are longest for the “best” countries 49 1. Equity Premium Puzzle ▪ Equity premiums very large in many places ▪ Theory with standard measures of risk aversion predicts an annual equity premium of 1.5% a year 50 1. Equity Premium Puzzle Explanations 51 Candidate explanation Findings Stock risk is actually higher Rare disaster risk (Barro 2006): with 1.7% chance of 40% default we generate a premium of 5.4% Risk aversion is actually higher High risk aversion can produce high risk premium for equity BUT cannot simultaneously explain low returns on bonds Loss aversion If stocks evaluated separately from bonds (narrow framing) then higher volatility entails severe loss aversion for stocks 1. Equity Premium Puzzle Explanations ▪ Other considerations: ▪ Incorrect measurement of market equity risk premium ➢ Period too short or sample size too small ➢ Goetzmann and Ibbotson (2005) find equity risk premium between 1792 and 1926 was only 3.66% in the US ▪ We observe realized, not expected, returns ➢ Fama and French 2002 suggest that the second half of the 20th century saw higher than expected returns 52 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle ▪ If we buy and hold a stock forever, price should be 𝑃𝑡 = 𝐷𝑡+1 𝑟−𝑔 ▪ How to test this? o Take a stock index o Compute present value of future realized dividends o Compare index’s market price to discounted cash flow 53 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle ▪ S&P500 (left) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (right) o Shiller 1981 o Solid line p is the index; dotted line p* is ex post rational price o Stock prices dramatically more volatile than subsequent dividends 54 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle ▪ Excess volatility still observed in recent times 55 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle 56 Price levels probably not correct, particularly when extreme But prices do fluctuate around “fundamentals” suggesting some predictability Preferences may change over time: sometimes investors are more risk averse, sometimes less – (theory does not explain when or why) Time-varying disaster risk (but cannot measure it) Investors may have wrong expectations about firm performance: sometimes too optimistic, sometimes too pessimistic Need to understand the psychology of belief formation Empirical evidence Standard Finance Account Behavioural Finance Account 2. Excess Volatility Puzzle ▪ Shiller 2003 puts forward feedback models: “A price to price feedback theory”. Speculative prices rise and this success encourages a fad and further price increases, if the loop continues sufficiently, this leads to bubbles Charles McKay “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds” (describing the 17th Century ‘tulipmania’) 57 Summary ▪ CAPM does not take into account some sources of return predictability o APT and multifactor models do a better job o SDF provides these models with a utility framework o While it can match the data, this framework does not explain it ▪ Puzzles about aggregate stock market o Equity premium puzzle o Excess volatility puzzle 58","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
