As discussed in the lecture, we observe two patterns: (1) investor portfolio behaviour seems to exhibit home bias and (2) home bias has been decreasing over time. Which existing theory (or theories) do you think best rationalizes both of these patterns? 2. This problem considers tax arbitrage by a multinational corporation—M Corp. M Corp. produces one good, the GyroPhone. A GyroPhone is a smart phone with a unique feature: it has a built in gyroscope which is activated whenever the user takes or initiates a call. In order to “control” the phone, the user must grip the phone tightly and resist the motion of the gyroscope. Thereby, the user builds wrist strength. M Corp. is incorporated in country M, a country with a moderate corporate tax rate, τM = 0.50. GyroPhones are a niche product that appeals only to consumers in country H, a country with high corporate tax rate, τH = 0.50. To reduce manufacturing costs, M produces GyroPhones in country L, a country that happens to have a very low corporate tax rate, τL = 0.05. M’s wholly owned subsidiary, L, located in country L, buys commodity inputs in country L and uses these inputs to produce GyroPhones. The cost of the inputs required to produce one GyroPhone is given by c = 1. As well as input commodities, L may have to make royalty payments, R ≥ 0, to M for using M’s intellectual property in the production process. All of L’s after-tax profits are remitted to M through a dividend payment. GyroPhones produced in L are sold by L to another wholly owned subsidiary of M, H, located in country H. The transfer price, pT , charged by L to H for GyroPhones is represented by pT . These phones are sold to consumers in H for a price, pC = 2. H can sell exactly n = 1000 phones. All after-tax profits earned by H are remitted to M through a dividend payment. Assume that royalties (passive income) are taxed at residence and profits (active income) are taxed at source and that the tax authorities in M, L, and H will allow M to freely choose transfer prices and royalty payments. a. What combination of transfer price, pT and royalty payments, R, maximizes the after-tax profits of M? Because tax payments in countries H and L are never negative, you can assume that pT ≤ pC and pT ≥ c. b. In practice, what sort of tax regulations might be imposed in countries H and M to limit M’s ability to set transfer prices? c. What practical problems might countries H and M have when trying to restrict company M’s choice of transfer prices and royalty payment? 3. This question considers the effect of increasing date 2 (future) revenue on the example of creditor and debtor preferred debt developed in class. Assume that all of the assumptions of that example are satisfied except that revenue in state 2 at date 2 is given by R2 = 500 and that the undertaking the investment requires an investment of K = 85. a. Can the project be financed by creditor preferred debt? If your answer is no. Explain why. If you answer is yes, what is the face value of this debt? b. Can the project be financed by debtor-preferred debt? If your answer is no. Explain why. If you answer is yes, what is the face value of this debt? c. In class, we only considered debt that was due at date 1. Clearly, regardless of the state, cash flows at date 2 exceed the required investment by a wide margin. Why not finance the project with debt due at date 2? d. The nominal interest rate on one-period debt is the difference between the face value of the debt and the proceeds of the debt issue divided by the proceeds of the debt issue,( f − K)/K. Frequently, firms assert that obtaining low interest rate financing implies that the firm has obtained “cheap” financing. Based on your analysis, do you think that low interest rates necessary imply that debt financing is “cheap”? Tutorial:Wk. 7 2/2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
