In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. Dominant Strategies Consider the following two-player full-information games: Game 1. Each player decides between Yellow and Blue and they simultaneously announce their choices, resulting in the following pay-oﬀs: if they chose the same colour then they each receive 5, otherwise the one that chose Yellow receives 6 and the one that chose Blue receives 4. Game 2. Each player decides between Red and Green and they simultaneously announce their choices, resulting in the following pay-oﬀs: if they both chose Red then they each receive 3; if they both chose Green then they each receive 5; otherwise the one that chose Red receives 4 and the one that chose Green receives 2. (a) Are there dominant strategies in these games? Discuss whether you can predict how the players will play these games. Using the notion of dominant strategy, comment on the following theoretical questions: (b) In a game, is a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium a Nash Equilibrium, or vice versa? (c) How useful is the Nash Equilibrium concept for predicting the outcome of a game? 2. Dominant Strategies and Iterated Deletion Consider the following game: Left Centre Right Top 1 3 2 2 0 0 Bottom 2 2 0 0 1 3 (a) Use “iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies” to predict the outcome of the game. 1 Now, consider the alternative game: Left Centre Right Top 7 5 2 3 0 1 Bottom 1 2 3 3 6 4 (b) Can “iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies” help us to simplify the game? Verify that “iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies” does not help us get any further. Finally, consider the game: Left Centre Right Top 6 4 6 0 5 3 Bottom 3 4 2 1 3 1 (c) Verify that no strategy is strictly dominated. What if we use ‘iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies’ ? Why is this technique unsatisfactory? In the light of your ﬁndings in the above games, comment on the following theoretical claims: (d) If “iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies” results in a unique strategy for each player, the collection of those strategies is the Nash Equilibrium of the game. (e) If a collection of strategies is a Nash Equilibrium of a game, then those strategies survive “iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies”. 2 3. Dominant Strategies and Cournot The two ﬁrms in an industry have identical cost functions c(qk) = 2qk, k = 1, 2, and the inverse demand function in the industry is p(q) = 14 − q, where q = q1 + q2. (a) Verify that the optimal production for a joint-monopoly is qM = 6, while the Cournot equilibrium is for each ﬁrm to produce qC = 4. Suppose that each ﬁrm can simply choose to produce either 1 2qM = 3 (half the joint- monopoly quantity) or qC = 4 (the Cournot quantity). (b) Write down the one-shot simultaneous-move game corresponding to this simpliﬁed set-up and show that each ﬁrm has a dominant strategy. Discuss. 4. Pure and Mixed Strategies I Consider the following game: Left Right Up 3 5 1 1 Down 0 0 5 3 (a) Identify the Nash Equilibria in pure strategies. (b) Is there a Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies, where Column plays Right with probability p and Row plays Up with probability q? If so, what is each player’s expected payoﬀ? Is this better or worse than a player’s average payoﬀ across the two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria? Why? 5. Pure and Mixed Strategies II Consider the two-player, one-shot, simultaneous-move game, parameterised by v: Left Right Up v 0 2 2 Down 0 3 3 0 (a) Find all Nash equilibria, in pure and mixed strategies, when v < 2, say v = 1. (b) Find all the Nash equilibria, in pure and mixed strategies, when v > 2, say v = 3. (c) What if v = 2 ? 3 6. Simultaneous and Sequential Moves I Consider the following two-player, one-shot, simultaneous-move game: Left Right Up 4 6 5 3 Down 3 5 2 2 (a) Identify the unique Nash equilibrium, in pure strategies, of this game. Now consider a variant of the previous game in which the Row player moves ﬁrst, followed by the Column player. (b) Represent the game using the extensive form and identify the subgame perfect equilibrium of the game. Is the subgame perfect equilibrium a Nash equilibrium? (c) What happens if the roles are reversed, and the Row player is the ‘follower’ ? 7. Simultaneous and Sequential Moves II There are two players, that can either use an ‘old’ technology, or a ‘new’ technology. Each player must make an irrevocable decision to stay with the ‘old’ or move to the ‘new’. The beneﬁt to a player from staying with the ‘old’ depends on what the other does, and is simply the number that stay (1, or 2 if the other also stays). The beneﬁt to a player from moving to the ‘new’ also depends on what the other does, and is 3 times the number that move (3, or 6 if the other also moves). Staying ‘old’ is free, but moving ‘new’ is costly: a player has to pay 2 to adopt the ‘new’ technology. (a) Draw the payoﬀ matrix of this game, and indicate any pure-strategy Nash equi- libria when the players move simultaneously. (b) Is any of the Nash equilibria that you identiﬁed Pareto eﬃcient? If so, which one? (c) If the cost of adopting the ‘new’ technology was only 1, what would be your prediction of the outcome of the simultaneous-move game in part (b), and why? (d) Draw the sequential game in which one player moves ﬁrst, and identify the sub- game perfect equilibrium. Explain brieﬂy whether or not your answer would change if the cost was only 1. Finally, comment on the following theoretical question: (e) Why is it said that the notion of subgame perfect equilibrium is a reﬁnement of the Nash equilibrium notion? 4 8. Subgame Perfect Equilibrium At stage 1, player 1 can play either Left (L) or Right (R). If player 1 plays L, then, at stage 2, player 2 can play left (ℓ) resulting in a payoﬀ of 2 to player 1 & 5 to player 2, or centre (c), with payoﬀs (3,4), or right (r) with payoﬀs (4,3). If player 1 plays R, then player 2 can play up (u) with payoﬀs (6,1), or play down (d) with payoﬀs (1,6). (a) What are player 1’s pure strategies in the former game? (b) What are player 2’s? (c) Draw the game tree and determine the subgame perfect equilibrium. 9. Repeated Game Consider the following one-shot game: Left Centre Right Top 8 8 9 5 7 3 Middle 5 9 6 6 4 1 Bottom 3 7 1 4 2 2 (a) Explain what is meant by the notion of “iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies”. Find the Nash equilibrium of the one-shot game above using this notion. (b) If the game is played inﬁnitely often, discuss for which values of the common discount factor δ ∈ (0, 1), the following strategies constitute a Nash equilibria of the repeated game: the Row player plays Top and the Column player plays Left unless either player has deviated, in which case they both switch to the equilibrium actions of the one-shot game forever. (c) Whenever the strategies in part (b) constitute an equilibrium, is this subgame perfect? Explain. 5 10. Repeated Game and Folk Theorem Consider the following Prisoner’s Dilemma one-shot game: C D C 5 5 8 1 D 1 8 4 4 where C stands for “cooperate” and D stands for “defect”. (a) What is the unique Nash equilibrium of the one-shot game? (b) If players have the same discount factor δ, and the one-stage game is played N times, identify a Nash equilibrium of the repeated game. Are there any others? If not, why not? If there are, what are they? (c) If the one-shot game is played an inﬁnite number of times, determine for which values of δ the following trigger strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium: player 1 plays C in the ﬁrst period and continues to do so until player 2 plays D, in which case player 1 switches to D forever; player 2 plays C in the ﬁrst period and continues to do so until player 1 plays D, in which case player 2 switches to D forever. (d) Do the above strategies constitute a subgame perfect equilibrium? Why, or why not? Finally, discuss the following theoretical questions: (e) Deﬁne appropriately the notions of ‘minmax punishment’ ‘individually rational strategy’ and ‘feasible payoﬀ pair’. (f) Explain the content of the Folk Theorem on an inﬁnitely repeated game like the one described above. 11. Repeated Game and Collusion Consider two ﬁrms that are playing a Bertrand game at each stage of an inﬁnitely repeated game. They have the same discount factor δ < 1 and the same constant marginal cost c. If they co-operate in the stage game then they each produce half the monopoly quantity qm and sell at the monopoly price pm. (a) What strategies, based on a threat of charging c in the stage game, will produce the collusive outcome? (b) For what values of δ do these strategies constitute a sub-game perfect Nash equi- librium? 6 Essay-style Questions 1. “A good way to understand why players might play a Nash equilibrium is to invoke players’ power of reasoning in analysing the situation.” Do you agree? 2. What is a ‘credible threat’ ? Why is this notion central to game theory? 3. A parent of three children, who are certainly gluttons, buys ten candies. The parent orders that the eldest child must form three, non-empty but otherwise of any size, sets of candies. Then, the three children will pick up one of the sets in the following order: ﬁrst the youngest child, then the eldest child, and ﬁnally the middle child. Model this situation as a sequential game and discuss how to use backward induction to determine the best division strategy. How does your answer change if the order of choice is: ﬁrst the youngest child, then the middle child, then the eldest child? How important is to understand correctly the gluttony motives of the children to predict what is going to happen? 4. “Given their extensive training with penalty kicks, every professional football player must surely understand how to play the rock, paper and scissors game”.
