METAPHYSICS AND THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 1. >Perhaps the best scepticism-rebutting argument in favour of the existence of body is the quasi-scientific argument ... that the existence of a world of physical objects having more or less the properties which current science attributes to them provides the best available explanation of the phenomena of experience= (STRAWSON). Discuss. 2. Is there anything that you and no one else could know? 3. Can we have rational grounds for a belief that our memories of our childhood thoughts are correct? 4. >The key to understanding perception is not sensation but discrimination.= Discuss. 5. >If I see someone else peel a potato, ... I don=t see the knife making the peel come up. And what I most obviously fail to see, though I do judge, is that each bit of the peel would not have come up if the knife had not moved in there= (MACKIE). Is it correct to say that causation is not observable? 6. Can one meaningfully ask for a description of things as they are in themselves, rather than as they appear to us? 7. If I know that p, and it is true that p only if it is true that q, must I know that q? 8. Is induction mere habit? 9. Do we need both the categories of substance and event? 10. >The trouble with explaining necessity in terms of possible worlds is that no one knows what worlds are possible.= Discuss. 11. Is it possible to give an account of the identity of persons which respects the usual logic of identity? 12. > ... it is perfectly clear that, if there were such a thing as this existence of individuals that we talk of, it would be absolutely impossible for it not to apply, and that is the characteristic of a mistake= (RUSSELL). Discuss. 13. Are there problems about the relation of mind and body that are not in principle answerable by scientific investigation? 14. >A knows a priori that p if and only if A believes that p and it is necessarily true that p.= Discuss. 15. Could there be a period of time during which nothing happened? 102 - 2 - 16. Could a thing have spatial location but no temporal location? 17. Are the properties of particular things themselves particular? 18. Is it arbitrary what is to count as a natural kind? 19. If metaphysics were eliminated, would any beliefs worth keeping be lost? PART B. THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 20. Does the underdetermination of theory by data undermine the idea that some theories are rationally accepted? 21. >The history of scientific revolutions makes scientific realism untenable.= Discuss. 22. In what sense, if any, is physics the fundamental science? 23. >Nothing can travel faster than light.= How would you explain the appropriate sense of >can=? 24. Is serious use of the concept of probability within scientific theories incompatible with determinism? 25. >Theories are no more conclusively falsifiable than they are conclusively verifiable.= Discuss. 26. Why is it wrong to explain the length of the flagpole by the length of the shadow? 27. >Instrumentalists make weaker claims than realists; the former, therefore, are more likely to be right.= Discuss. - END OF PAPER - 102 - 3 -","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
