Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. EITHER (a) Can one know without being in a position to know that one knows? (h) Suppose that I would still believe P, were P false. Does it follow that I do not in fact know that P? EITHER (a) 'Contextualism about the verb \"know\" is the best response to scepticism.' Discuss. (h) How do we know we are not dreaming? 'The phenomena of illusion and hallucination show that we never really perceive external objects.' Discuss. 'If a trusted acquaintance, who knows that P, tells one that P, then one automatically comes to know that P.' Discuss. You are told that there will be a surprise exam sometime next week. You reason that it can't be on the last day of next week because it would not then be a surprise. You reason that since you know it is not going to be on the last day it can't be on the second to last day either since it would not be a surprise then either. You continue to reason in this fashion and conclude that there will not be a surprise exam. What has gone wrong? If I think it is probable that P and you think it is probable that not-P then what, if anything, makes one of us right and one of us wrong? 'If someone's beliefs cohere then it follows that they are at least justified in holding the beliefs that they do.' Discuss. 'All our beliefs are sensitive to what we have learned from others in the past and to what we learn from others in the future. Therefore there is no such thing as apriori knowledge.' Discuss. Do we have any reason to believe that the sun will rise tomorrow? 'Unless I already know what is possible, I cannot know what possible worlds there are. So possible worlds can shed no light on our understanding of modality.' Discuss. Do shadows exist? When do a plurality of objects compose a single object? Always? Never? Sometimes? Does our birth cause our death? 'Since people are organisms, and since there are no psychological constraints on organism identity over time, there are no psychological constraints on personal - identity over time.' Discuss. 'The distinction between primary and secondary qualities is useless, based on antiquated science and a muddle of confused criteria.' Discuss. Do objects have temporal parts? 'There is nothing metaphysically special about the present.' Discuss. By virtue of what is an atom the very atom that it is? Could the table at which you are now sitting have been made of ice? Can a distinction be drawn between properties that exist, and properties that don't exist? If so, how would you draw that distinction? If not, then how can it matter whether we say that properties exist or not? LAST PAGE","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
