Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. EITHER (a) Are there any mental states such that one is always in a position to know whether one is in them? OR (b) Do you have the same evidence as your brain-in-a-vat counterpart? 2. EITHER (a) Is epistemology a pastime which destroys its own subject matter? OR (b) In what sense, if any, does knowledge depend on practical interests? 3. ‘One sees if and only if the scene before one’s eyes causes matching visual experience.’ Discuss. 4. ‘A belief is justified only if it is justified by a mental state with propositional content. The only mental states with propositional content are beliefs. Therefore, immediate justification is impossible.’ Discuss. 5. In what sense, if any, is a priori knowledge justified ‘independently of experience’? 6. Does the best explanation of observed regularities imply the existence of unobserved regularities? 7. Can two epistemic peers with the same evidence rationally disagree? 8. How, if at all, do the attitudes you ought to have at a time depend on the attitudes you have at other times? 9. Must S know that p for T to know that p on S’s say-so? 10. ‘Epistemic injustice is just the unjust distribution of epistemic goods. Therefore, there is no distinctive phenomenon of epistemic injustice.’ Discuss. 11. Is it ever true to say of two atoms that they once were, or will be, numerically identical? 12. Are you an animal? What, if anything, does your answer imply about the metaphysics of personal identity through time? A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 13. EITHER (a) Are there tables or only atoms arranged table-wise? OR (b) Is it possible for objects of the same kind to coincide? 14. ‘While the past seems settled, the future seems open.’ What is the best explanation of this apparent asymmetry? 15. Are necessarily co-extensive properties identical? 16. What might it mean to say that a kind is ‘socially constructed’? Are racial kinds socially constructed in this sense? 17. ‘There could have been no concrete objects. Therefore, possible worlds are not concrete objects.’ Discuss. 18. If a short-circuit starts a house fire, which triggers a sprinkler system that puts out the fire, did the short-circuit cause the failure of the house to burn down? 19. Are any dispositions extrinsic? 20. What, if anything, ground truths about what grounds what?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
