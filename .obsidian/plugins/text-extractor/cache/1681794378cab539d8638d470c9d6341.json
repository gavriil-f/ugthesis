Iterated Deletion [Exam 2012, Part А] (a) Explain what is meant by the ‘iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies’. In the first step, any dominated strategy is removed from the set of strategies of each player, since no rational player would ever play such a strategy. This results in a ‘smaller’ game. Some strategies that were not dominated before may now be dominated in this smaller game. The above step is repeated, leading to an even smaller game, and so on. (Common knowledge of rationality among players is assumed.) Note: If, when this process stops, only one strategy remains for each player, then that strategy profile is the unique Nash equilibrium. (b) Use the above notion to find the Nash equilibrium of the following two-player, simultaneous-move, full-information game when it is played once. Тей Centre Right 8 9 7 Top ' 8 5 3 5 6 4 Middle 9 6 1 3 1 2 Bottom 7 4 2 (The row player receives the payoff in the bottom-left corner of the cells, and the column player receives the payoff in the top-right corner of the cells.) Step 1: Top strictly dominates Bottom; Left strictly dominates Right. (No other possibilities. This now leaves a ‘prisoners’ dilemma’.) Step 2: Middle strictly dominates Top; Centre strictly dominates Left. Therefore, (Middle, Centre) is the unique Nash equilibrium. (c) Now assume that the above game is played infinitely often, and that the players have a common discount factor § < 1. Consider the following strategies: the Row player plays Top and the Column player plays Left unless either player has deviated, in which case they both switch to the equilibrium actions of the one-shot game forever.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
