Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. 0102 2 1. What truth, if any, is there in coherentist accounts of justification? What truth, if any, in foundationalist accounts? Is there any hope of reconciling the two views? 2. EITHER (a) Are there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism? OR (b) ‘The best responses to the problem of external world scepticism ultimately concede a lot to the sceptic.’ Discuss. 3. ‘Externalist accounts of knowledge implausibly imply that a subject can know that P even if they are being unreasonable in believing that P.’ Is this so? 4. ‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge? 5. Do accounts of a priori knowledge have a problem with explaining how there can be contingent a priori claims? 6. What would it take to solve the problem of induction? 7. What kind(s) of relation(s) hold between Fred and a fig when Fred sees a fig? 8. Is there any interesting sense in which colours are mind-dependent? 9. Is memory a matter of having access to the past? If so, how is such access possible? 10. Is there any plausible account of the nature of mind which would make knowledge of other minds possible? Does an acceptable account of mind have to make such knowledge possible? 11. ‘Bayesianism offers no illumination on any of the traditional problems of epistemology, since it classes them all under “choice of prior”.’ Is this a valid criticism of Bayesianism? 12. Does the psychological view of personal identity face challenges that other views on personal identity easily avoid? 13. In what sense, if any, does time flow in a particular direction? 14. What is the best account of how objects can gain or lose parts over time? 15. ‘Jane studies philosophy, but she could have studied history.’ Should such claims be understood in terms of possible worlds? 0102 3 LAST PAGE 16. Do we need to postulate the existence of properties in order to explain how objects can resemble each other? 17. Is backwards causation possible on a Humean account of causation? Does your answer tell for, or against, the Humean account? 18. Do we have any good evidence that there are any mind-independent facts? 19. ‘There are only two plausible views on composition: either every class of objects has a mereological sum, or no class of objects has a mereological sum.’ Discuss.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
