A binary relation R is a function iff for all d, e, f : if ⟨d, e⟩ ∈ R and ⟨d, f ⟩ ∈ R then e = f . A binary relation R is an equivalence relation on S iff R is reflexive on S, symmetric on S and transitive on S. The range of a function R is the set {e : there is a d such that ⟨d, e⟩ ∈ sR}. The domain of a function R is the set {d : there is an e such that ⟨d, e⟩ ∈ sR}. Definition Function into Definition Function notation Definition n-ary relation Definition Argument Definition Logical validity Definition Consistency Definition Logical truth (L1) Definition Contradiction (L1) Definition Logical equivalence (L1) Definition Sentence letters If d is in the domain of a function R one writes R(d) for the unique object e such that ⟨d, e⟩ is in R. R is a function into the set M iff all elements of the range of the function are in M. An argument consists of a set of declarative sentences (the premises) and a declarative sentence (the conclu- sion) marked as the concluded sentence. An n-place relation is a set containing only n-tuples. An n-place relation is called a relation of arity n. A set of sentences is logically consistent iff there is at least one interpretation under which all sentences of the set are true. An argument is logically valid iff there is no interpre- tation under which the premises are all true and the conclusion false. A sentence is a contradiction iff it is false under all interpretations. A sentence is logically true iff it is true under any interpretation. P, Q, R, P1, Q1, R1, P2, Q2, R2 and so on. Sentences are logically equivalent iff they are true un- der exactly the same interpretations. Definition Sentence of L1 Definition Bracketing convention Definition L1-structure Definition Truth in an L1-structure Definition Negation truth table Definition Conjunction truth table Definition Disjunction truth table Definition Implication truth table Definition Equivalence truth table Definition Logical truth (L1) 1. The outer brackets may be omitted from a sen- tence that is not a part of another sentence. 2. The inner set of brackets may be omitted from a sentence of the form ((ϕ∧ψ)∧χ) and analogously for lor. 3. Suppose ⋄ ∈ {∧, ∨} and ◦ ∈ {→, ↔}. Then if (ϕ ◦ (ψ ⋄ χ)) or ((ϕ ⋄ ψ) ◦ χ) occurs as part of the sentence that is to be abbreviated, the inner set of brackets may be omitted. (i) All sentence letters are sentences of L1. (ii) If ϕ and ψ are sentences of L1, then ¬ϕ, (ϕ ∧ ψ), (ϕ ∨ ψ), (ϕ → ψ) and (ϕ ↔ ψ) are sentences of L1. (iii) Nothing else is a sentence of L1. Let A be some L1-structure. Then |...|A assigns either T or F to every sentence of L1-structure in the follow- ing way. An L1-structure is an assignment of exactly one truth- value (T or F ) to every sentence letter of L1. ϕ ψ ϕ ∧ ψ T T T T F F F T F F F F ϕ ¬ϕ T F F T ϕ ψ ϕ → ψ T T T T F F F T T F F T ϕ ψ ϕ ∨ ψ T T T T F T F T T F F F A sentence ϕ of L1 is logically true iff ϕ is true in all L1-structures. ϕ ψ ϕ ↔ ψ T T T T F F F T F F F T Definition Contradiction (L1) Definition Logical equivalence (L1) Definition Validity (L1) Definition Counterexamples Definition Semantic consistency (L1) Definition Truth-functionality Definition Scope of a connective in L1 Definition Tautology (L2) Definition Contradiction (L2) Definition Propositional consistency A sentence ϕ and a sentence ψ of L1 are logically equivalent iff ϕ and ψ are true in exactly the same L1-structures. A sentence ϕ of L1 is a contradiction iff ϕ is not true in any L1-structures. An L1-structure is a counterexample to the argument with Γ as the set of premises and ϕ as the conclusion iff for all γ ∈ Γ we have |γ|A = T but |ϕ|A = F . Let Γ be a set of sentences of L1 and ϕ a sentence L1. The argument with all sentences in Γ as premises and ϕ as conclusion is valid iff there is no L1-structure in which all sentences in Γ are true and ϕ is false. A connective is truth-functional iff the truth-value of the compound sentence cannot be changed by replac- ing a direct subsentence with another sentence having the same truth-value. A set Γ of L1-sentences is semantically consistent iff there is an L1-structure A such that for all sentence γ ∈ Γ we have |γ|A = T . A set Γ of L1-sentences is semantically inconsistent iff Γ is not semantically consistent. An English sentence is a tautology iff its formalisation in propositional logic is logically true. The scope of an occurrence of a connective in a sen- tence ϕ of L1 is the occurrence of the smallest subsen- tence of ϕ that contains this occurence of the connec- tive. A set of English sentences is propositionally consistent iff the set of all their formalisations in propositional logic is semantically consistent. An English sentence is a contradiction iff its formali- sation in propositional logic is a contradiction. Definition Propositional validity Definition Propositional validity Definition Predicate letters Definition Arity Definition Constants Definition Variables Definition Atomic formulae of L2 Definition Quantifier Definition Formulae of L2 Definition Free occurrence of a variable An argument in English propositionally valid iff its formalisation in L1 is valid. An argument in English propositionally valid iff its formalisation in L1 is valid. The value of the upper index of a predicate letter is called its arity. If a predicate letter does not have an upper index its arity is 0. All expressions of the form P k n , Q k n, Rk n are predicate letters where k and n are either missing or a numeral ’1’, ’2’, ... x, y, z, x1, y1, z1, x2, x2, x2, ... are variables. a, b, c, a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2, ... are constants. A quantifier is an expression ∀v or ∃v where v is a variable. If Z is a predicate letter of arity n and each of t1, ...tn is a variable or constant, then Zt1...tn is an atomic formula of L2. (i) All occurrences of variables in atomic formulae are free. (ii) The occurrences of a variable that are free in ϕ and ψ are also free in ¬ϕ, ϕ ∧ ψ, ϕ ∨ ψ, ϕ → ψ and ϕ ↔ ψ. (iii) In a formula ∀vϕ or ∃vϕ no occurrence of the variable v is free; all occurrences of variables other than v that are free in ϕ are also free in ∀vϕ and ∃vϕ. (iv) An occurrence of a variable is bound in a formula iff it is not free. (v) A variable occurs freely in a formula iff there is at least one free occurrence of the variable in the formula. (i) All atomic formulae of L2 are formulae of L2. (ii) If ϕ and ψ are formulae of L2, then ¬ϕ, (ϕ ∧ ψ), (ϕ ∨ ψ), (ϕ → ψ) and (ϕ ↔ ψ) are sentences of L2. (iii) If v is a variable and ϕ is a formula then ∀vϕ and ∃vϕ are formulae of L2 (iv) Nothing else is a formula of L2. Definition Sentence of L2 Definition L2-structure Definition Variable assignment Definition Variable assignment Definition Satisfaction Definition Truth Definition Logical truth (L2) Definition Contradiction (L2) Definition Logical equivalence (L2) Definition Semantic consistency (L2) An L2-structure is an ordered pair ⟨D, I⟩ where D is some non-empty set and I is a function from the set of all constants, sentence letters, and predicate letters such that: 1. The value of every constant is an element of D. 2. The value of every sentence letter is a truth-value T or F . 3. The value of every n-ary predicate letter is an n-ary relation. A formula of L2 is a sentence of L2 iff no variable occurs freely in the formula. A variable assignment over an L2-structure A assigns an element of the domain DA of A to each variable. A variable assignment over an L2-structure A assigns an element of the domain DA of A to each variable. A sentence ϕ is true in an L2-structure A iff |ϕ| α A = T for all variable assignments α over A. Assume A is an L2-structure, α is a variable assignment over A, ϕ and ψ are formulae of L2, and v is a variable. For a sentence letter ϕ either |ϕ|α A = T or |ϕ|α A = T obtains. Formulae other than sentence letters receive the following semantic values: (i) |Φt1..., tn|α A = T iff ⟨|t1|α A, ..., tn|α A⟩ ∈ |Φ|α A, where Φ is an n-ary predicate letter for n ≥ 1 and each of t1, ..., tn is either a variable or a constant. (ii) |¬ϕ|α A = T iff |ϕ|α A = F and so on... (iii) |∀vϕ|α A = T iff |ϕ|β A = T for all variable assignments β over A differing from α in v at most. (iv) |∃vϕ|α A = T iff |ϕ|β A = T for at least one variable assign- ment β over A differing from α in v at most. A sentence ϕ of L2 is logically true iff ϕ is true in all L2-structures. A sentence ϕ of L2 is logically true iff ϕ is true in all L2-structures. A set Γ of L2-sentences is semantically consistent iff there is an L2-structure A in which all sentences in Γ are true. A set of L2-sentences is semantically incon- sistent iff it is not semantically consistent Sentences ϕ and ψ of L2 are logically equivalent iff both are true in exactly the same L2-structures.
