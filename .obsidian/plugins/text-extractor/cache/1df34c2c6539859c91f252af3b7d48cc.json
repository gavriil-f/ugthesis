If I have stronger evidence for P than I do for Q, is it possible for me to know that Q but not to know that P? What is the significance of your answer? EITHER (a) Does the claim that we perceive objects directly do anything to help in answering scepticism about the external world? OR (b) Of which can I be more certain: the existence of physical objects, or the existence of other minds? Can some inductive arguments be shown to be probable? If so, how? If not, does this imply that all inductive arguments are equally bad? Should our confidence in testimony be based purely on the extent to which we have experienced ‘conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses’ (HUME)? If I decide to call the tallest man in the world ‘Lofty’, do I know apriori who is the tallest man in the world? ‘Let’s just make it a matter of stipulation that an analytic statement is, in some sense, true by virtue of its meaning and true in all possible worlds by virtue of its meaning. Then something which is analytically true will be both necessary and a priori.’ (KRIPKE) Discuss. ‘We have no epistemic access to other possible worlds, so to explain our understanding of modality in terms of possible worlds is hopeless.’ Is it? Could you have had different parents? If so, how? If not, does this mean that it was impossible for your parents to remain childless? Is there any good argument for the claim that every truth must have a truth-maker? Can we expect to reason coherently about things that don’t exist? Are the past and future any less real than the present? Is it logically possible for me to remember somebody else’s experiences? What does your answer imply about the possibility of treating memory as a criterion of personal identity? What is the connection, if‘any, between causation and counterfactuals? -2- 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 0102 Does Modern Epistemology need a distinction between primary and secondary qualities? EITHER (a) What is the problem of universals? Does it matter how we solve it? OR (b) ‘The decisive question [in ontology] is not the alleged ontological question of the existence of abstract entities but rather the question whether the use of abstract linguistic forms . . . is expedient and fruitful’. (CARNAP) Is Carnap right? ‘I can’t possibly be mistaken about what I am now feeling and thinking.’ Can I not? Are things any more than bundles of properties? If so, what? ‘The problem of Theseus’s ship is just a matter of which later ship we choose to call “identical” with the earlier ship.’ Is persistence through time just a verbal matter, then? Does it make any sense to talk of something’s being outside space? How central to philosophy is epistemology? PART B: PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE Is structural realism any sort of improvement on standard realism? What is the connection between ‘It is a law that Fs are Gs’ and ‘All Fs are Gs’? ‘ [Elven in endorsing a simple perceptual judgement, and certainly in accepting any theory as empirically adequate, I am sticking my neck out. There is no argument here for belief in the truth of the accepted theories, since it is not an epistemological principle that one might as well hang for a sheep as for a lamb.’ (VAN FRAASSEN) Discuss. A realist might argue: ‘Until such time as anyone produces an actual example of underdetermination of theory by data, I am justified.in disregarding it as a problem for realism’. Is this correct? Assess the role of ‘observation sentences’in Quine’s philosophy of science. Does observation of a green frog confirm ‘All ravens are black’? If not, why not? ‘[Tlo explain an event is to give some information about its causal history.’ (LEWIS) Do you agree? -3- 29. 30. Has Popper’s work brought us any closer to a resolution of the problem of induction? Do ‘scientific revolutions’ undermine the view that science is progressive? - END OF PAPER - LAST PAGE 0102 -4-","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
