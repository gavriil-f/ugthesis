Verify that ‘iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies’ does not help us get any further.

However, it is dominated by a mized strategy such В 1 я 1 ав Left w.p. 3, Right w.p. 5- With Centre having been deleted, we are left with a ‘‘battle of the sexes\" and no remaining strategies are dominated.? (c) In the next game, no strategy is strictly dominated. (Verify.) What if we use ‘iterated deletion of weakly dominated strategies’? Why is this technique unsat- isfactory? Тей Centre Right 6 6 5 Top ! 4 0 3 3 2 3 Bottom 4 1 1 Both Centre and Right are weakly dominated by Left. If we first delete Centre, then Top weakly dominates Bottom; and if we then delete Bottom, then Left is dominant, and our predicted outcome is (Top, Left). However, if we first delete Right, then Bottom weakly dominates Top; and if we now delete Top, then Left is again dominant, so our predicted outcome becomes (Bottom, Left) . This technique has the undesirable property that the order in which weakly dominated strategies are deleted can matter. 2In two-player games, the strategies that survive ‘iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies’ and those that survive ‘iterated deletion of never-best-responses’ can be shown to be identical. But care must be taken when identifying ‘never-best-responses’: increase Column’s payoffs from playing Centre by 2, for example (so 4 against Top and 5 against Bottom) — Centre is now not dominated by any mix of Left and Right, although it is still never a best response to any pure strategy of Row's. However, if Row plays а mixed strategy such ав Top w.p. , Bottom w.p. 2, Column gets ап expected payoff оЁ 3 from Left, апа of 4 from Right, each оё which is strictly less Column’s expected payoff from Centre — 50 Centre is the best response to some strategy оЁ Row’s апа cannot be deleted ав а ‘never-best-response’","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
