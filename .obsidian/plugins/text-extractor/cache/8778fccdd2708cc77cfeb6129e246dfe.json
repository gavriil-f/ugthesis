Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. A12693W1 2 1. Can positing variation across contexts of standards for ascribing knowledge help solve sceptical puzzles? 2. EITHER (a) What, if anything, is wrong with the view that knowledge is rationally held reliably true belief? OR (b) Is knowledge the most general factive mental state? 3. ‘There are no reasons to be sceptical about the existence of other conscious persons that are not equally reasons to be sceptical about the existence of mind-independent solid objects with size, shape and location.’ Do you agree? 4. ‘One is justified in holding a belief B only if one has some reason to think it likely to be true. A reason to think B likely to be true cannot be anything other than some other belief or beliefs that indicate the truth of B. So there is no viable foundationalism that does not collapse into a form of coherentism.’ Discuss. 5. An item is grue if and only if either it is observed before a certain time T and is green, or it is not observed before T and is blue. Suppose that over 10,000 emeralds have been observed prior to time T and all were grue. Should one on that basis expect the first emerald observed after T to be grue? 6. EITHER (a) Are there any contingent truths that are knowable a priori? OR (b) Does an appeal to intellectual intuition play a role in explaining how we are able to have a priori knowledge? 7. What is the significance of the possibility of perceptual illusions for the epistemology of perception? 8. EITHER (a) ‘Understanding other people’s eye-witness accounts affords one epistemic access to states of affairs they have observed and now report, in much the same way that one’s memory affords one present access to past states of affairs which one oneself once observed.’ Discuss. OR (b) To what extent does one’s dependence on others for much of what one knows compromise one’s ability to take responsibility for one’s own beliefs? A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 9. Is there a distinct phenomenon of epistemic injustice? 10. Do psychological factors have the upper hand in accommodating our intuitions about when persons persist over time? Are psychological factors dominant in determining our intuitions regarding what it takes for a person to persist over time? 11. EITHER (a) ‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADY- MINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? OR (b) Are there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring? 12. Is there a useful distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic properties? 13. ‘No individual exists in more than one possible world, so possible worlds are of no use in accounting for possibility and necessity claims concerning particular individuals.’ Discuss. 14. Critically compare two or more alternative accounts of causation. 15. ‘There is no good solution to the special composition question. So we should accept universalism about composition.’ Is this a good argument? 16. Can the claim that an object is disposed to M when C be explained in counterfactual terms? 17. Is there any interesting distinction between properties such as colour and taste versus properties such as shape and mass? 18. Is time travel possible? What does this tell us about the nature of time? 19. What is the best methodology for resolving ontological disputes?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
