What determines these? ▪ CAPM is an equilibrium model of asset pricing, when many (heterogeneous) agents trade stocks ▪ Balancing demand and supply of stocks generates prices that exhibit risk-return trade-off, and other predictions Finance8 CAPM Assumptions ▪ Everyone has mean-variance preferences o differ in risk aversion 𝛾 ▪ Everyone has same beliefs about means and variances ▪ All investors small relative to overall market - perfect competition – so all price takers ▪ One period only ▪ All investments are available ▪ No taxes, no transaction costs ▪ Borrowing and lending possible at risk-free rate Finance9 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 1 ▪ These assumptions imply that all investors ✓ agree on the shape of the efficient frontier ✓ agree on the exact composition of the tangency portfolio ✓ have an identical optimal portfolio of risky assets o They may differ in how much of their wealth they devote to the tangency portfolio versus the risk-free asset, but every dollar invested in risky assets is invested with the weights dictated by the tangency portfolio ▪ We add to this structure by adding the notion of equilibrium in the markets for risky assets Finance 10 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 1 ▪ Demand side of market: ➢ All investors hold risky assets in the proportions dictated by the tangency portfolio – thus, the tangency portfolio summarises the demand for risk assets ▪ Supply side of market: ➢ The stocks issued by all firms in our economy make up the supply of risky assets. The market portfolio summarises this supply of risky assets where the market portfolio is the value weighted portfolio of all risky assets Finance 11 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 1 ▪ Equilibrium statement: the tangency portfolio must be exactly the market portfolio ▪ Assume that at its current price, the tangency portfolio weight of i is below its market portfolio weight. Then supply of i shares is greater than demand. So, the price of i would drop: – weight of i in market portfolio will decrease – weight of i in tangency portfolio will increase (investors buy more as it’s cheaper). ▪ This process continues until market portfolio weight equals tangency portfolio weight Finance 12 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 ▪ The (marginal) contribution of risky asset i in a portfolio P is given by its return-to-risk ratio (RRR): 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 𝜎𝑖,𝑃 𝜎𝑃 ▪ For the market portfolio M to be optimal, the return-to- risk ratio (RRR) of all risky assets must be the same: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 −𝑟𝑓 𝜎𝑖,𝑀 𝜎𝑀 = 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 −𝑟𝑓 𝜎𝑀 Finance 13 CAPM “Derivation”, Part 2 ▪ From which it follows: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖,𝑟𝑀) 𝜎𝑀 2 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝜎𝑖𝜌𝑖,𝑀 𝜎𝑀 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓 ▪ So expected return on asset i is: 𝑬 𝒓𝒊 = 𝒓𝒇 + 𝜷𝒊 𝒓𝒎 − 𝒓𝒇 o where 𝛽𝑖 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖,𝑟𝑀) 𝜎𝑀 2 and 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓 = market risk premium Finance 14 Beta, 𝛽𝑖 ▪ 𝛽𝑖 measures the contribution of asset i to the variance of M as a fraction of the total variance of M ▪ i.e., it measure how sensitive i is to market movements ▪ If the CAPM is correct, 𝛽 captures everything relevant: expected returns, correlations and systematic risk ▪ The beta of a stock will be large if either or both of the following occurs: o 𝜌𝑖,𝑀 is large (near one), i.e. the pattern of i’s returns is closely similar to the market o 𝜎𝑖 is large relative to 𝜎𝑀, which implies that the returns to i are much more variable than market returns Finance 15 Security Market Line ▪ If CAPM holds, then for each asset i: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓 where, 𝛽𝑖 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖,𝑟𝑚) 𝜎𝑚 2 ▪ Linear relationship between 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 and 𝛽𝑖 across stocks = SML o CAPM says each security should lie on SML o Position 𝛽𝑖 on SML reflects stock 𝑖’s exposure to systematic risk 16  E(r) rf Security Market Line 1 Market portfolio Security Market Line ▪ Is Security X mispriced? ▪ If so, is it under- or over-priced? 17  E(r) rf Security Market Line 1 Market portfolio Security X CML vs SML 18 CML vs SML ▪ CML graphs the risk premiums of efficient portfolios (i.e., portfolios composed of the market and the risk-free asset) as a function of portfolio standard deviation ➢ This is appropriate because standard deviation is a valid measure of risk for efficiently diversified portfolios that are candidates for an investor’s overall portfolio ▪ SML graphs individual asset risk premiums as a function of asset risk. The relevant measure of risk for individual assets held as parts of well-diversified portfolios is not the asset’s standard deviation; rather it’s the contribution of the asset to the portfolio variance, which we measure by the asset’s beta Finance 19 How Can We Test CAPM? ▪ Key prediction: stock returns across stocks (“cross section”) 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑟𝑓 + 𝛽𝑖 𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓 where 𝛽𝑖 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣(𝑟𝑖, 𝑟𝑚) 𝜎𝑚 2 o expected return compensates for systematic risk, i.e. exposure to market ▪ Idea: if we measure 𝛽𝑖, can we predict 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 from (𝑟𝑀,𝑡−𝑟𝑓,𝑡) ? 20 Testing CAPM ▪ Two stage approach 1. For each asset 𝑖 “run regression” to estimate 𝛽𝑖 : 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑖(𝑟𝑚,𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓,𝑡) + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 2. Test CAPM by running cross-section regressions: 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝛽𝑖 + 𝑐𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 o where 𝑋𝑖 are other potential predictors of returns o test whether 𝑎 = 𝑟𝑓 , 𝑏 = 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 and 𝑐 = 0 21 Detour On Linear Regressions ▪ Linear regression model 𝑦 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑥 + 𝜀 o 𝑦 is dependent variable, 𝑥 is independent variable (many other names) o 𝜀 is error term o 𝛼 is intercept parameter and 𝛽 is slope parameter 22 Detour On Linear Regressions ▪ Linear regression model 𝑦 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑥 + 𝜀 o 𝑦 is dependent variable, 𝑥 is independent variable (many other names) o 𝜀 is error term o 𝛼 is intercept parameter and 𝛽 is slope parameter ▪ 𝑦 and 𝑥 are observable random variables ▪ 𝜀 is not observable: captures everything that determines 𝑦 other than 𝑥 23 Detour On Linear Regressions ▪ Goal: determine parameters 𝑎, 𝛽 that best describe the relation between 𝑥 and 𝑦 ▪ Assumptions on error term: o 𝐸 𝜀 = 0 (just means that 𝛼 = 𝐸 𝑦 − 𝛽[𝑥]) o 𝐸 𝜀|𝑥 = 0 (conditional mean independence) ▪ Implies 𝜀 that fits the equation is uncorrelated with 𝑥 o Regardless of whether 𝑥 is low or high, average error is the same o Holds if linear model approximately describes true relation o Otherwise model is mis-specified, estimation is biased 24 Detour On Linear Regressions ▪ For now, assume the linear model is correct ▪ Estimate parameters ො𝛼, መ𝛽 that minimize the error function ෍ 𝑖 𝑦𝑖 − ො𝛼 − መ𝛽𝑥𝑖 2 o Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method ▪ Yields estimates: ො𝛼 = 𝐸 𝑦 − መ𝛽 𝑥 , መ𝛽 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣 𝑦, 𝑥 𝜎𝑥 2 25 Detour On Linear Regressions ▪ Estimates ො𝛼, መ𝛽 depend on the sample o If sample size is small, they may be biased ▪ Bigger problem: omitted variables o If variable 𝑧 predicts 𝑦 and correlates with 𝑥, then 𝐸 𝜀|𝑥 ≠ 0: መ𝛽𝑥 is capturing some of the variation in 𝑦 that is due to 𝑧 o Add 𝑧 to the regression (“control for 𝑧”) to get better estimate of link between 𝑥 and 𝑦 26 Back To Testing CAPM ▪ Regression 𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑖(𝑟𝑚,𝑡 − 𝑟𝑓,𝑡) + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 gives estimate of theoretically predicted CAPM 𝛽 = 𝑐𝑜𝑣 𝑟𝑖,𝑟𝑚 𝜎𝑚 2 ▪ Run cross-section regressions: 𝑟𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝑏𝛽𝑖 + 𝑐𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 o 𝑋𝑖 are other potential predictors of returns o test whether the slope is 𝑏 = 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 (and intercept is 𝛼 = 𝑟𝑓) o and whether no other variables predict returns, 𝑐 = 0 27 Empirical Evaluation Of CAPM ▪ Evidence suggests that o returns are related to betas rather than eg. an asset’s variance (total risk): good o empirical security market line is flatter than predicted by the CAPM, 𝑏 < 𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 : not so good o other characteristics 𝑋𝑖 have explanatory power beyond beta in stock returns, 𝑐 ≠ 0 bad 28 Black, Jensen and Scholes 1972 Empirical Evaluation Of CAPM ▪ CAPM worked less well in recent times ▪ The dots show the actual average risk premiums from portfolios with different betas over different periods ▪ The relation between beta and actual average return has been much weaker since the mid- 1960s 29 Testing For Alpha ▪ Related approach: if CAPM holds, then setting: 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖(𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑖 should yield 𝛼𝑖 = 0 o controlling for market exposure, 𝛽𝑖(𝐸 𝑟𝑀 − 𝑟𝑓), asset i’s excess returns 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 − 𝑟𝑓 should not be predictable o in contrast, practitioners often “search for alpha” 30 Testing For Alpha 31 Testing For Alpha 32 ▪ Recall that SML is flatter than predicted by the CAPM o so “betting against beta” yields predictable excess returns o below: monthly alphas (Frazzini and Pedersen 2014) Testing For Alpha 33 ▪ Betting against beta holds across many markets o this is a common theme for departures from CAPM o such departures are capturing something systematic. More next week. Back To Testing CAPM ▪ Recall that in cross-section regressions 𝑟𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝑏𝛽𝑖 + 𝑐𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖 several variables 𝑋𝑖 have been found to predict returns, after controlling for market exposure ▪ most of these take the form of firms’ characteristics 34 Other Factors Predicting Returns ▪ Small-Firm effect (Banz 1981): o Small stocks have outperformed large stocks o Average annual returns between 1926 and 2021 are consistently higher on the small-firm portfolios 35 Other Factors Predicting Returns ▪ Book-to-Market ratios (Fama & French 1992): o Book value of firm’s equity/ Market value of equity predicts returns o After controlling for size and B-to-M effects, FF also found that 𝛽 had no power in explaining average returns 36 Other Factors Predicting Returns 37 ▪ Since 1926 the average annual difference between the returns on small-caps and large-caps has been 3.1% ▪ Since 1926 the average annual difference between the returns on value and growth stocks has been 4%. Other Factors Predicting Returns ▪ Post-earnings announcement drift (Ball & Brown 1968) o Unexpectedly good earnings news yields greater average abnormal returns than release of unexpectedly bad earnings. This outperformance persists for several months. ▪ Momentum (Novy-Marx 2013) o Historical winners continue to significantly outperform historical losers ▪ Accruals and earnings quality (Sloan 2006) o High accruals predict low future returns; management manipulation of earnings reported ▪ There are plenty of others unearthed by empirical work… 38 Other Factors Predicting Returns ▪ Post-earnings announcement drift (Ball & Brown 1968) o Unexpectedly good earnings news yields greater average abnormal returns than release of unexpectedly bad earnings. This outperformance persists for several months ▪ Momentum (Novy-Marx 2013) o Historical winners continue to significantly outperform historical losers ▪ Accruals and earnings quality (Sloan 2006) o High accruals predict low future returns; management manipulation of earnings reported Is this evidence compatible with market efficiency? 39 Assumptions Behind CAPM ▪ CAPM makes several assumptions: o mean variance preferences o homogeneous rational expectations o one-period horizon o no non-financial assets o perfect capital markets • unlimited borrowing/lending at risk-free rate • no transaction costs, no taxes • investors are price-takers • unlimited short sales 40 Assumptions Behind CAPM ▪ How restrictive are some of these assumptions? o Transaction costs? >> problem for smaller stocks o Unlimited short sales? >> not always o Other assets? >> human capital, private business o Homogeneous beliefs? >> if so, then no trade theorems, >> clear evidence of disagreement o Rational expectations? >> compatible with disagreement, but recent work suggests departures from RE 41 Assumptions Behind CAPM ▪ How restrictive are some of these assumptions? o Transaction costs? >> problem for smaller stocks o Unlimited short sales? >> not always o Other assets? >> human capital, private business o Homogeneous beliefs? >> if so, then no trade theorems, >> clear evidence of disagreement o Rational expectations? >> compatible with disagreement, but recent work suggests departures from RE ▪ Can relaxing some assumptions help explain the evidence?... 42 Problems Testing CAPM 1. CAPM is about expectations o Expected returns not observed → calibrate model on historic returns o BUT: historic returns may differ from expectations • Yet if we assume RE, CAPM predictions should hold on average • There exist surveys of market participants’ expectations of returns on the stock market, but CAPM is a model of the cross section of stocks • Equity analysis issue “price targets”, but issues of inference and incentives complicate their interpretation 43 Problems Testing CAPM 2. What is the “market portfolio”? o S&P500 is mostly used as US market proxy (FTSE 100 (250) in the UK) o BUT: Investors hold many other assets not reflected in S&P500 • foreign equity, human capital, real estate, pensions o Extensions of CAPM take this into account 44 Problems Testing CAPM 3. What is the “risk-free rate”? o Use interest rates of government bonds (treasury yields) o BUT: which maturity? • Often use long-term (10-20y) bond yields • For short-term investments, maturity-matched interest rates are appropriate o AND: real or nominal? • For real return need to estimate inflation and adjust interest rate or cash flow 45 Problems Testing CAPM 2+3. Market proxy & risk-free rate affect market risk premium o Average excess returns of the market over the risk-free rate 46 Problems Testing CAPM 4. Finding or estimating beta? o Estimate CAPM equation from historic return data • 𝐸 𝑟𝑖 = 𝑎 + 𝛽𝑖(𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓) + 𝜀𝑖 o BUT: which time horizon? • For stocks, use at least two years of weekly or five years of monthly return data? o AND: stock-specific or industry-wide beta? • Practitioners use average industry betas 47 Problems Testing CAPM 4.

How to take debt-equity mix into account? using firm discount rate: 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 Firm Discount Rate 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 ▪ Firm discount rate required for firm valuation 𝑉𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 = ∑𝑡=0 ∞ 𝐸(𝐷𝐼𝑉𝑡) (1 + 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚)𝑡 • Generally, not the required rate of return on equity, 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 ≠ 𝑟𝐸 55 Firm Discount Rate 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 ▪ Firm discount rate required for firm valuation 𝑉𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 = ∑𝑡=0 ∞ 𝐸(𝐷𝐼𝑉𝑡) (1 + 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚)𝑡 • Generally, not the required rate of return on equity, 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 ≠ 𝑟𝐸 ▪ If the debt-to-equity ratio is fixed: o 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 = 𝑟𝐸 𝐸 𝑉 + 𝑟𝐷 𝐷 𝑉 • rD is the interest paid on debt, V=D+E is the value of the firm 56 Firm Discount Rate 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 ▪ In practice, the debt-to-equity ratio does change o debt-equity ratio can stray from target, e.g. if CFO thinks stock is overpriced o periodically adjust leverage to bring it back into line with the target o 𝑟𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑚 is not the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 57 Valuing Projects ▪ Necessary condition for investment: o PV of the project is larger than the required investment, i.e. 𝑁𝑃𝑉 = ∑𝑡=0 𝑇 𝐸(𝐶𝐹𝑡) (1 + 𝑟)𝑡 ≥ 0 where CF0 = - investment ▪ Which cash flows? Which discount rate? 58 Valuing Projects: Cash Flows ▪ Only care about cash flow generated by the new project → incremental cash flows ▪ NPV must o Include all changes in cash flow that result from your decision to invest in a particular project • opportunity costs, e.g. other projects • indirect effects on incremental earnings, e.g. sales of a complementary product o Exclude cash flows that you would receive / pay regardless of whether or not you choose to invest. • sunk costs that have been or will be paid regardless of the investment (e.g. past R&D) 59 Valuing Projects: 3 Approaches 1. Consider all real flows associated with the project o Use WACC as discount rate applied to all flows 2. Consider only flows to the shareholder o Cash flows associated with debt should not be included o Estimate the beta for equity, and use this to generate the discount rate 3. Use Adjusted Present Value approach 60 1. Project Approach ▪ Discount real flows of project by w 𝑉 = 𝐹1 1 + 𝑤 + 𝐹2 1 + 𝑤 2 + ⋯ o where 𝑤 is appropriate discount rate for this project, typically the WACC 𝑤 = 𝑟𝐸 𝐸 𝑉 + 𝑟𝐷 𝐷 𝑉 61 2. Consider Only Flows To Shareholders ▪ Discount flows to shareholder by 𝑟𝐸 𝐸 = 𝐹1 − 𝑖𝐵1 1 + 𝑟𝐸 + 𝐹2 − 𝑖𝐵2 1 + 𝑟𝐸 2 + ⋯ o where 𝑟𝐸 is the required rate of return on equity, o where 𝑖𝐵1 is payment of interest 62 3. Adjusted Present Value Method ▪ Calculate value of firm as if there were no debt o ignore flows to lenders in the numerator o discount by required return to equity o adjustments (tax benefits of debt, bankruptcy risks) 63 Modigliani-Miller Theorem: The value of a firm is independent of its capital structure (in absence of taxes, bankruptcy, asymmetric info, market inefficiency…) CAPM Summary ▪ CAPM remains the predominant model used to determine the cost of capital o Equilibrium model that highlights key economic forces: risk-return trade off, diversification, trading and learning o It is used for investment, valuation and capital budgeting ▪ Systematic departures from CAPM prompted development of more complex models that build on it o relaxing assumptions of perfect markets, no non-financial assets o incorporating departures from rational expectations 64","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
