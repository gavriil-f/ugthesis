In answering this, bear in mind what the alternative hypotheses are. Question 2 Suppose a team of Oxford researchers proposes a new “age” factor to explain the cross section of stock returns, which consists of the difference in the returns on firms with old CEOs vs returns on firms young CEOs.   Explain how you would test whether such a factor helps predict stock returns over and beyond the CAPM.   Suppose the proposed factor does help predict returns as in the previous question. Describe some of the objections that a believer in the CAPM would have to such results. How would you try to address these concerns? please describe the other factors in the Fama French model.  In testing the predictability of returns from the Oxford factor, should you use the CAPM or the Fama French model as your benchmark?  Question 3 What is the excess volatility puzzle? What explanations have been proposed? How can you test these accounts?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
