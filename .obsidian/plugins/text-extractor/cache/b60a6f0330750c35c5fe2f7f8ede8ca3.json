Answer THREE questions. Do not turn over the page until told that you may do so. 0102 2 1. ‘The theory that knowledge is justified true belief is a simple and powerful proposal. Just as we accept simple and powerful, but highly counterintuitive, theories in fundamental physics, so too we may accept the knowledge proposal despite its counterintuitive consequences.’ Discuss. 2. ‘Disjunctivism is untrue to the phenomenology of perceptual experience.’ Discuss. 3. Can a subject have a justified belief that p if there is another subject with all the same evidence whose belief that p is not justified? 4. Can some form of externalism solve the problem of induction? 5. Can I know that p yet be unaware that I know that p? 6. Is it rational to believe each member of a finite set of propositions but fail to believe their conjunction? 7. ‘When S knows that p, that is a non-linguistic fact about S’s mental state. That fact will obtain regardless of the linguistic context, and, hence, S will know that p in every such context. So epistemic contextualism is false.’ Discuss. 8. Could you be dreaming and still have the same evidence that you currently have? 9. ‘It is more useful to think of a priori status as attaching primarily to justified belief rather than knowledge.’ Discuss. 10. ‘An event A is a cause of a distinct event B just in case bringing about the occurrence of A would be an effective means by which a free agent could bring about the occurrence of B.’ (MENZIES and PRICE) Is it? 11. Could two distinct possible situations be qualitatively identical, differing only by permutation of their inhabitants? 12. Is modality best understood using quantification over possible worlds? 13. If you are a person, are you essentially a person? 14. Can we make sense of change over time without appealing to temporal parts? 15. ‘There are no tables or chairs or any other visible objects except living organisms.’ (VAN INWAGEN) Discuss. 0102 3 L AST PAGE 16. Could an object with no parts wholly occupy an extended region? 17. How do universals ground resemblance? 18. If what is true depends on what exists, how can a presentist explain the truth of ‘Dinosaurs used to roam around in what is now Oxfordshire’? 19. Are ontological disputes merely verbal disputes over the choice of conventional linguistic framework?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
