In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. General Equilibrium with an Externality Consider a pure exchange economy with two goods, x and y, and two equally large groups of consumers, a and b. The preferences of each type a consumer are represented by the utility function ua(xa, ya, xb) = ln xa + 2 ln ya − ln xb, and they each have an endowment of (6, 0), whereas the preferences of each type b consumer are represented by the utility function ub(xb, yb) = ln xb + 2 ln yb, and they each have an endowment of (0, 6). (a) Calculate the Walrasian equilibrium (b) Is the equilibrium Pareto eﬃcient? If not, can you suggest a Pareto improvement? Assume now that there is only one consumer of each type. (c) Will the outcome of bargaining in this new economy be Pareto eﬃcient? Why? (d) Characterise the outcome qualitatively by comparing it with the equilibrium from part (a), i.e. how do the relative price and allocation change? [You do not need to provide a complete analytical solution in part (d).] 2. Externalities: Revelation A ﬁrm imposes an external eﬀect, h, on a consumer. This externality can take two possible values, 0 and 1. Payoﬀs are given below, where x and y denote wealth (transferable between the ﬁrm and the consumer), and b > 0 and c > 0 denote beneﬁts and costs respectively. h = 0 h = 1 Firm x x + b Consumer y y − c The government wishes to impose a ban if and only if h = 0 is a Pareto optimal level of the externality. It announces that it will ask the ﬁrm to report b and the consumer to report c and will then ban the externality if the consumer’s reported cost exceeds the ﬁrm’s reported beneﬁt, and allow the externality otherwise. (a) Assume that the ﬁrm and consumer hear the announcement, make their reports, and the government acts accordingly. Does it follow that the resulting level of the externality will be Pareto optimal? (b) Suppose the government adds the following caveat: in the event that the exter- nality is allowed, the ﬁrm is to pay a tax equal to the consumer’s reported cost, and the consumer is to receive a subsidy equal to the ﬁrm’s reported beneﬁt. Will the resulting level of the externality be Pareto optimal now? What are the consequences for the government’s budget? 1 3. Externalities: Gains from Trade Two students, a and b, live in college. Student a has only one hobby: listening to “******” music. 2 Student a’s music system can produce noise levels of up to 100 decibels. Her utility depends on the loudness of the sound, D, and the amount of money she has, m a. Her preferences are represented by the utility function: ua(m a, D) = 10D 1 2 + ma . Student b lives next door to student a and is irritated by the loud music he has to put up with. His preferences are represented by the utility function: u b(m b, D) = 10(100 − D) 1 2 + mb , where mb denotes the amount of money he has. (a) Draw student a’s marginal beneﬁt curve and student b’s marginal cost curve. (b) Term is nearly over and student a has run out of money. What is her utility? (c) What would be a Pareto eﬃcient noise level? (d) Student b has £100. What is the maximum “bribe” he is willing to pay to student a to turn down her music to a Pareto-eﬃcient level? Would £50 be suﬃcient? (e) Draw an Edgeworth box to illustrate this problem, carefully indicating the initial endowment, the contract curve, and the outcome if the £50 bribe is accepted. 4. Externalities: Eﬃciency and Distribution Consider an economy in which wealth is transferable, and where consumer a imposes an externality, h, on consumer b, with 0 ≤ h ≤ 50. At this level of the externality, and when consumer a and b have wealth wa and wb, respectively, consumer a has utility 10h 1/2 + wa, and consumer b has utility 10(50 − h)1/2 + wb. (a) What is the level of h that maximises consumer a’s utility? What is the level of h in any Pareto optimal allocation? Suppose that the right to an externality-free environment is assigned to consumer b. Further, assume that there is a competitive market for the right to generate one unit of the externality. Consumer a chooses how many rights to buy, ha, taking the price of each right, p, as given; consumer b chooses how many rights to sell, hb, taking the price p as given. (b) Write down consumer a’s maximisation problem and obtain the ﬁrst-order con- dition. Repeat this exercise for consumer b. Hence obtain the equilibrium price and the equilibrium allocation. 2Insert your least preferred genre of music. 2 (c) Show that the equilibrium allocation is eﬃcient. Determine the utilities of the consumers (net of initial wealth), and the gains from trade. How is the equilibrium price in this competitive market for the right to generate one unit of the externality related to the optimal Pigouvian tax? (d) Consider an alternative trading procedure where consumer b makes a ‘take-it- or-leave-it-oﬀer’ to consumer a. How would the outcome diﬀer from that in the competitive market, in terms of eﬃciency and distribution? [Hint: You do not need to perform any further calculations.] 5. Externalities: The Coase Theorem A ﬁrm generates an externality that aﬀects a consumer, and this externality takes one of two possible values, h = 0 or h = 1. When h = 1, the ﬁrm derives a beneﬁt b, while the consumer suﬀers a cost of 4. Payoﬀs are summarised below, where x and y denote wealth (transferable between the ﬁrm and the consumer). h = 0 h = 1 Firm x x + b Consumer y y − 4 Assume initially that b > 4. (a) Which level of the externality would be eﬃcient? Explain why. (b) The consumer has the right to an externality-free environment, but can make a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ oﬀer to the ﬁrm: “You pay me t and I will permit you to set h = 1.” (Assume that the ﬁrm agrees to pay if and only if b ≥ t.) What amount will the consumer demand? Will the outcome be eﬃcient? (c) Suppose instead that the ﬁrm has the right to produce the externality. What will happen in this case? (d) How would the analysis be diﬀerent if b < 4? (e) Explain how this example illustrates the Coase Theorem, commenting in partic- ular on the implications of the initial assignment of property rights. 3 6. Externalities: Taxes and Quotas I A ﬁrm is deciding how much pollution to emit. Its proﬁt depends on pollution h, a managerial eﬃciency parameter η, and the amount of money wf that it has. Its proﬁt function is π(h; η) = wf + η h − 2h 2. The pollution aﬀects a consumer living nearby. The consumer’s preferences are repre- sented by the utility function φ(h) = wc − h 2, where wc denotes the amount of money she has. (a) When η = 24, (i) what level of pollution will the ﬁrm choose to emit? (ii) what is the optimal quota to impose? (iii) what is the optimal Pigouvian tax per unit? Illustrate your answers on a diagram. (b) Assume now that η = 36. (i) Calculate the deadweight loss that would arise if the government implemented the quota level from part (a). (ii) Using the diagram, or otherwise, would the tax level from part (a) be a better policy? 7. Externalities: Taxes and Quotas II A proﬁt-maximising ﬁrm is deciding how much pollution to emit. Its proﬁt depends on the level of emission h, and the amount of money wf it has: its proﬁt function is π(h) = wf + 24h − 2h 2. The pollution aﬀects a consumer living nearby. The consumer’s payoﬀ depends on the level of emission h, a parameter θ capturing how badly the pollution aﬀects her, and the amount of money wc she has: her preferences are represented by the utility function φ(h; θ) = wc − 6θh − h 2. (a) What level of pollution will the ﬁrm choose to emit? (b) Show that the Pareto optimal level of pollution is 4−θ. Brieﬂy, why is it decreasing in θ? (c) Obtain an expression for the optimal Pigouvian tax as a function of θ. Comment on your answer. (d) The government does not know how badly the pollution aﬀects the consumer; that is, the parameter θ is the consumer’s private information. In view of this information problem, which would be the better instrument choice, a tax or a quota, or doesn’t it matter in this case? Explain. 4 8. Common Resources I On an island there are 2 lakes and 16 ﬁshermen. Each ﬁsherman can ﬁsh on either lake. When L1 men ﬁsh on lake 1, the total number of ﬁsh caught there is F1(L1) = 8L1 − 1 2(L1) 2 and when L2 men ﬁsh on lake 2, the total number of ﬁsh caught there is F2(L2) = 4L2. Assume that all men on a given lake catch the same number of ﬁsh. (a) In this unregulated situation, how may men will ﬁsh on lake 1, how many on lake 2, and how many ﬁsh will be caught altogether? (b) The island chief believes that she can increase the total number of ﬁsh caught by restricting the number of men ﬁshing on lake 1. What is the number of men ﬁshing on lake 1 that maximises the number of ﬁsh caught altogether, and what is the number of ﬁsh caught in this situation? Explain why the chief is correct. (c) Since she is opposed to coercion, the chief decides to issue permits in order to ﬁsh on lake 1. If she is to bring about the optimal allocation of labour, how much should a permit cost (in terms of ﬁsh)? 9. Common Resources II (a) What is the tragedy of the commons? Use the concepts of rivalry and excludability in your answer. A particular road is used by N drivers each day. Each driver obtains a beneﬁt v from the journey, and incurs a cost c(N ) that increases with the number of drivers on the road, because of congestion. The cost incurred by each driver is given by: c(N ) = a + bN (b) Show that the equilibrium number of drivers using the road will be: Ne = v − a b (c) Write down an expression for the social surplus, W (total beneﬁts minus costs), provided by the road when it is used by N drivers. Find the number of drivers, N ∗, at which the social surplus is maximised. What is the social surplus when N = Ne? Comment on your answers. (d) Suppose the government charges a toll, t, (a congestion charge) for each journey. Find the optimum toll. Interpret your answer in terms of the externality that each driver imposes on others. By spending an amount X on road improvements, the government reduces the cost per trip to: c(N, X) = a + bN − gX Assume there is no congestion charge. 5 (e) Write down the new expression for the social surplus, W (including the cost, X, incurred by the government), when there are N drivers. Find the new equilibrium traﬃc ﬂow, Ne, and the equilibrium social surplus. Comment on the social value of road improvements. 10. Equilibrium with a Public Good Two students, a and b, share a house. Heat for this house is a pure public good. Student a feels the cold. Her (derived) beneﬁt from x units of heat is: 3 φ a(x) = 20x − x2 2 . Student b is a hardier soul. Her (derived) beneﬁt from x units of heat is: φ b(x) = 15x − x2 . The heating system runs on prepayment cards. Each student can provide units of heat by purchasing cards from a single proﬁt-maximising heat supply ﬁrm. This ﬁrm’s cost of supplying q units of heat is: c(q) = 2q2 . Let xa denote the units of heat purchased by student a, and xb the units of heat purchased by student b. Total heat provision is then x = xa + xb. Assume that both students, as well as the ﬁrm, take the market price of heat as given. Assume, also, that each student takes her housemate’s purchase of heat as given. (a) At a competitive (Nash-Cournot) equilibrium involving price p∗, student a’s pur- chase of the public good, xa∗, must maximise her utility given xb∗. Write down this utility maximisation problem and obtain the ﬁrst-order condition. Repeat this exercise for student b. Will both students purchase heat? (b) At a competitive equilibrium involving price p∗, the ﬁrm’s public good supply, q∗, must maximise its proﬁts. Write down the ﬁrm’s proﬁt maximisation problem and obtain the ﬁrst-order condition. (c) Use your answers above, together with a market clearing condition, to solve for the competitive equilibrium price, p∗, and provision of heat, q∗. (d) Is the competitive equilibrium eﬃcient? What would be a Pareto optimal provi- sion of heat, qo? (e) Illustrate q∗ and qo in a diagram, carefully indicating the student’s marginal private beneﬁt curves, the marginal social beneﬁt curve and the marginal social cost curve. 3Note we are assuming that the quantity of heat has no eﬀect on prices of other goods and preferences are quasi-linear with respect to the same numeraire traded commodity. 6 11. Public Goods: Voluntary Contributions A village has n residents, who each obtain utility from private goods, and a public good, ﬂood defences. Resident i has utility function Ui = yi + aQ − Q2 100 where Q is the level of ﬂood defences, and yi is individual’s i expenditure on private goods. Flood defence costs c per unit. (a) Find the marginal private beneﬁt of ﬂood defences for resident i. Write down and explain the Samuelson condition for optimal provision of the public good. Hence, the people agree to provide ﬂood defences by voluntary contribution. Resident i purchases a quantity qi, taking the contributions of everyone else as given. (b) Find the reaction function of person 1, as a function of the contributions of others. (c) How much of the public good will be provided in total, in a symmetric equilibrium in which each person provides the same amount? Why does it not depend on the number of residents? (d) Discuss your results, illustrating them in a diagram showing the private and social marginal beneﬁts and costs as a function of Q. 12. Public Goods: Revelation The gross valuations of a public good for the four households of a small economy are 25, 20, 16 and 2 respectively. The cost of providing the public good is 60 and, if provided, each household will contribute 15 towards the cost. Should the public good be provided? Use a Clarke-Groves mechanism to determine who is pivotal and how much tax they should pay. What can you say about the net beneﬁt (after the contribution to the cost and the tax) of the pivotal households? How do your answers change when the gross valuations are 5, 10, 14 and 28? 7 Essay-style Questions 1. What techniques are available to estimate the expected social value of a proposed public investment project (e.g. an infrastructure project)? Why might the techniques and valuations used for a public project diﬀer from those used in calculating a private commercial rate of return? 2. Discuss various approaches for measuring the welfare eﬀects of social media. 3. As part of its commitment to reduce smoking prevalence, the UK government an- nounced in spring 2020 an increase in Tobacco duty rates by 2% above inﬂation. Discuss what are the likely eﬃciency and distributional eﬀects of this measure. 4. What considerations determine the eﬃcient levels of (a) smoking and (b) immuniza- tion against infectious diseases? 5. Why cannot all externality problems be resolved by bargaining between the parties involved? In such circumstances, how might government intervene? 6. “The ﬁrst welfare theorem and the Coase theorem convey the same message: self- interested economic agents can bring about eﬃcient outcomes.” Discuss. 7. Explain the distinction between depletable and non-depletable externalities. Does this theoretical distinction have any practical relevance for environmental policy? 8. What instruments are available to the authorities to tackle the problems associated with negative externalities? In practice, which of these is appropriate when dealing with a local externality problem (such as pollution of rivers and lakes), and how is this altered by the problem being a global one, such as climate change? 9. A government wishes to control emissions of a harmful pollutant and is debating whether to impose a tax on emissions or to issue a ﬁxed number of emissions permits. Explain which instrument you would advise the government to use, carefully setting out the reasons for your choice. Is the use of a combination better than using taxes or permits alone? 10. Should pollution be regarded as a negative externality or a public bad? 8 11. It is reasonable to expect climate change policy to be both eﬃcient and equitable? What is the role of side payments across nations and generations? 12. Would a permit scheme be better than a tax scheme for the control of global warming? Under what circumstances would a hybrid scheme improve on both? 13. Should climate change be addressed through taxation? If so, how should the price of carbon emissions be set? 14. Explain why the competitive equilibrium allocation of a public good is, in general, ineﬃcient. Outline and assess one of the following policy responses: either (a) use a Clarke-Groves mechanism, or (b) use a system of personalised Lindahl prices. 15. How does the presence of privately held information about the beneﬁt that an agent derives from a public good confound attempts to achieve a Pareto optimal allocation of resources? 16. Should the policy response to the problem of public good provision depend on whether the good is excludable? 17. When can the exclusion of a consumer from use of a public good lead to an increase in welfare? 18. What does microeconomic theory tell us about the private provision of public goods? Do the television services oﬀered by BSkyB 4 accord well with the theory? 19. Is there an economically eﬃcient way of pricing radio broadcasts? 20. “Free-riding implies that teamwork is ineﬃcient.” Does it? 21. Should Wikipedia be taxed or subsidised? 22. How should society go about deciding whether or not to build a high speed rail line? 23. “Tradeable conscription permits are an eﬃcient way to provide national defence.” Discuss. 4BSkyB is a satellite broadcasting company, and is the largest pay-TV broadcaster in Britain. 9","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
