D: Because I have all these people, you see, J, and these patriots are telling me that— there’s a lot of them you know—… J: Tell me, D, can our senses decieve us? Ordinarily, when we conceive of our perceiving something, we think there is not much doubt involved. When I see the time nearing 3 o’clock, I have no doubt that my essay is due in soon; just as H. H. Price had no doubt he was seeing the tomato in that ‘red patch of a round and somewhat bulgy shape’ (1932, 3). We don’t, for instance, think we are victims of some LSD-induced hallucination; or some real-life rendition of The Truman Show; or an illusion of some other sort; or a Cartesian evil demon (or a brain in a vat, for that matter). In this way we tend to take our senses’ word for it; and we take the world as it is. Moreover, we think and act as though we have some immediate connection to that real/physical/mind- independent/actual/objective/external world out there. Price—who is standing, presumably, in a tomato \u0000\u0000eld—takes it that the ‘whole \u0000\u0000eld of colour,’ is directly ‘present in [his] consciousness’ (ibid). Directly synonymous, too, is P. F. Strawson’s understanding of his ‘sensible experiences’ as embodying, ‘an immediate consciousness of the existence of things outside us’ ([1979] 2011, 132). What this is all to say is that we presume there are no things—nothing—mediating our perceptual access to the external world. But these ordinary beliefs (and indeed Strawson too) are wrong. For just as a hallucination deceives our senses, the thesis of direct realism deceives those who accept it. We do not directly perceive the external world, nor its ordinary objects. Rather, we perceive representations of these objects. More precisely, in making this case I defend a particular kind of representationalism, a tracking representationalism. The essay is structured as so. §1 sketches an outline of the problem at hand; that of the puzzle perception and the prospect of direct realism as an answer. §2 confronts direct realism head on, showing that (at least the naïve sort) cannot constitute an adequate account of perception, since it fails to consistently identify the character of perceptual experience. In short, it rejects the Common Factor Principle, and I reject the theory for it. §3 takes my argument in the positive direction, introducing (indirect) representationalism en large as the viable and desirable alternative. I then consider two candidates for a preferred representationalism, discussing and eventually rejecting belief acquisition theory in §4, then endorsing tracking representationalism in §5. I present two key motivations for the particular view, namely its conception of perception in the language of intentionality, and, (perhaps the more emotionally appealing) couching provides for physicalism and empirical science. Ultimately, then, the crux of the argument lies primarily not in the negative claim, but in the positive one: we ought not conceive of perception in directGavriil FakihTT 2024 realist terms because, simply, the epistemological, ontological, and phenomenological opportunity cost is too high. 1. Direct realism about perception We seem to comfortably accept that our perceptual experiences, judgements, etc. have a kind of phenomenal character to them. That is to say that there is something it is like to perceive (Nagel 1974, 438). There is something it is like to see Price’s tomato in the tomato \u0000\u0000eld. There is also something it is like to pick it up, hold it, and take a bite out of it; these are all sorts of experiences that characterise the phenomenal aspect of perception. We can perceive the tomato lying in the \u0000\u0000eld, feel it in our hands, and taste it, all seemingly by virtue of its phenomenal properties. But we can’t simply take it for granted that we can perceive such things. As Ayer, Strawson, Mackie, and many others (in essence) point out: nothing comes for free—and certainly not in philosophy. And the exercise isn’t just for the sake of it, since, as Fish sets out, there are at least three very good reasons to want an answer to this question. On the epistemological front we need answers to what exactly our primary source of knowledge (perception) is. On the phenomenological front, we want to be able to ask what it is like to perceive; and on the ontological, perhaps what it means for the world to be (im/)perceptible. The answers to this puzzle will have to explain at least two things. Not only (1) what it means to perceptually experience something—what the nature of such an experience is—but also, (2) what this means for the character of the experience; that is, what determines it, and what type of thing is it. The very straightforward answer given to us by direct realists might seem the logical solution at \u0000\u0000rst glance. They say that to have a perceptual experience of something in the external world is to directly perceive some ordinary, mind-independent object. Breaking some of this down: what it means then to perceive the tomato, or alternatively the can of Red Bull fuelling me at my desk, is for (a) that thing to actually exist, i.e. its existence is independent of my mind experiencing it—it is a mind-independent thing. But also, (b) is for that thing to be the object of my experience; my perception of it. This already gives us a candidate answer with regard to question (1)—what a perceptual experience is meant to be. To speak in Strawsonian, it concerns a ‘sensible experience’ of an ordinary, mind-independent object out there in the external world. But what does the direct realist say about (2), the character of the experience? The reply is that it is a direct experience, wherein we perceive phenomena through an immediate consciousness or awareness of the external world. It is immediate in the sense that it is mediated by nothing; not senses, not ideas, not mental states, no things. Putting this together, direct realists can be understood to wield a dual pronged thesis. Firstly, the direct realist is a realist—she claims the existence of a world containing mind-independent objects, ‘variously propertied, located in a common space’ (Strawson ([1979] 2011, 128). But she is direct realist in that she holds that perception isn’t mediated by anything. Taking the realist element of the position to be less contentious feature, it is the directness that I will focus on hereon and aim to show is problematic. Note, however, that this is feature is not exclusive to the direct realist; other theories of perception can be so classi\u0000\u0000ed, and I intend for my argument to apply to the them all by virtue of their directness. 2. Hallucinations Put summarily, what direct realism cannot seem to account for is indistinguishable phenomenologies. As is tried-and-tested, to illustrate this point we can distinguish three types of cases of perception (Fish 2021, 15). Consider that all three of the following are possible ‘modes of sensible experiences’, in the sense that they describe possible situations an agent could run into when we would expect them to be visually experiencing something: 1 Veridical perception: when we, correctly, perceive something as what it is. 2 Illusions: when we see something in the wrong way. 3 Hallucinations: when we something that’s not there. Note that the nuance between illusions and hallucinations is important, but not to the argument at hand. For brevity I will focus on only one of these ‘bad’ cases of perception, namely hallucination, though the argument is structured relatively similarly in both. I choose hallucination because it appears more concrete; there appear to be plausible routes for the direct realist to escape largely unscathed from the argument from illusion (see e.g. French & Walters 2020). How exactly then does the argument work? The aim is to show that the direct realist’s account is incomplete. As mentioned, it has trouble with indistinguishable phenomena. The basic idea, then, is demonstrating this trouble by considering that the realist can provide no justi\u0000\u0000cation for considering hallucinations im-perceptions. One rendition might go like so: Some supporting and explanatory arguments. Premise (I) should be uncontroversial; there doesn’t seem a way to deny (unless perhaps one is hallucinating) that such hallucinations occur, let alone if they are possible. (II) should also be uncontentious as it is simply a rehashing of (I). Since if one experience is characterised as phenomenologically indistinguishable from another, then (de\u0000\u0000nitionally), they will seem I The phenomenology of hallucination is the same as the phenomenology of veridical perception; they are nominally indistinguishable. II When S hallucinates she is directly presented2 with an object that isn’t really there. III The same account of experience should be given across Veridical and Hallucination cases. C. We are never directly presented with ordinary objects (I, II, III). the exact same. So, if by direct realism a (actual) perception involves being directly presented with objects, then the hallucination which is indistinguishable from it will involve all its phenomenal qualities. Setting aside (III) for a moment; we should also be able to clearly see that how the conjunction of the three premises necessitates the conclusion. If I hallucinate the phenomena of being directly presented with my fully written essay, then by direct realism I don’t perceive it since it’s not really there; there is nothing existent to be the object of my perception. But given we were to also accept (III), how are we to account for nominally indistinguishable situations where we do in fact perceive something— like in a Veridical case where the essay is in fact \u0000\u0000nished, so I perceive it—and one where I do not? There doesn’t seem to be way to any way to plausibly maintain this tension without accepting the consequences… It seems then the argument rests on (III), the claim that we should have a continuity (Robinson 1994, 46), or commonality of sorts in our accounts of various experiences. Call this the Common Factor Principle, à la Fish (2021). What could motivate us to accept such a principle? To reiterate what was said in §1, what is central to a theory of perception is not only that it gives us some account or explanation of the nature of perceptual experience, but also that it describes its character; that is its phenomenal ‘goings-on’ so to speak. Put another way, for an experience, x, to have an indistinguishable phenomenology to another, distinct, experience y, is for it to have the same character. But if say, x, is an instance of perception, and y is not, then we better have a good way to explain this. A theory of perception that fails to do so, that does not accept CFP, is a half-baked theory at best, since it does not give us a complete understanding of perception. So given all this, direct realism, at least in the (so-called naïve) form I have till now described it as, fails at a crucial hurdle; it cannot account for the Common Factor Principle. But even if this was all there was to the story, we would still need an alternative theory, one that does \u0000\u0000nd itself incompatible with CFP, to turn to. 3. The alternative: representationalism Recall the two questions from §1 that we require adequate answers to: (1) the nature of perceptual experience, and (2) the character of perceptual experience. By saying we do in fact directly perceive the external world, direct realism holds that perceptual experience involves an unmediated access to the mind- independent array of all sorts of ordinary objects out there in the external world. An alternative approach—and in my view one that is epistemologically, phenomenologically, and ontologically superior—is representationalism. Various forms of representationalism may hold varying levels of realism about the external world; that is some representationalists will maintain a mind- independent external world exists in some meaningful sense, whilst others, like perhaps Robinson who (in some respects) \u0000\u0000irts with anti-realism, do not. What all representationalists do seem however deny is direct realism’s central doctrine of immediacy, at least in strict ontological sense. To reiterate, the latter hold that we perceive ordinary objects by having a direct access to them, the former that we do so by having only an indirect access. This position commits representationalists to what we can aptly term the Representational Principle; the thesis that by virtue of this or that feature of perception, or for this reason or another (there is quite substantial debate here), our access to the content of our perception is mediated by this or that thing. Some quali\u0000\u0000cations and clari\u0000\u0000cations. Firstly, is not only representationalists who might claim that we have indirect access to the external world. Those who hold a sense datum theory, one that revolves around the intermarriage of visual experience with mental objects, also hold experience to be indirect. But since I answer the question of concern—whether we experience the world directly—in the negative, I take it that o\u0000fering one alternative theory which I ‘perceive’ I can defend is su\u0000\u0000\u0000cient. So I’ll leave sense datum aside. Second, it can be argued (I think maybe plausibly?) that some forms of representationalism are entirely compatible with, if not explicitly in favour of, the notion that we in fact directly experience ordinary objects and the external world (see e.g. Crane and French 2021, §3.3 on intentionalism). Yet, put very brie\u0000\u0000y, this does not seem to fully embody the representationalist spirit. Not only is the theory an evolution of the aforementioned, explicitly indirect, sense datum view, but it concerns the representation of ordinary objects, oftentimes in our mental states. In this way, it does not seem immediately obvious to me how we could directly experience/perceive objects without directly experiencing/perceiving them. Sure, there would still be a nuanced distinction: in that it is not the external world as it is that is the object of our experience in this case, but rather in some sense the contents of our experiences, yet still this strikes me as somewhat bizarre, if not borderline incoherent. If anything, a simple retort that this doesn’t rise to the level of strict immediacy espoused by the direct realist should be su\u0000\u0000\u0000cient to put any relevant concern of smuggling in directness to bed. Third, and perhaps most importantly, what does content refer too? In a very inclusive sense, the content of an experience is how the world is represented by said experience. In turn, it is this content that is either equivalent to or that explains the character of our experiences. This gives us at least a brief glimpse of how the representationalist accounts for perception; and how she avoids the hallucination trap from earlier. Having given a sketch of the the general representationalist thesis, I now turn to two candidate views within the family. 4 Belief acquisition theory? One particularly promising view is that of belief acquisition theory, the core tenet of which holds that visual experiences involve not just a subject sensing sense data, about say having the perceptual experience of a blue thing in the shape of a duck, but the subject actually acquiring the belief that that is in fact a blue duck. Thus, the theory is representationalist in the sense that the perceiving of something is understood in terms of the subject—not directly accessing some phenomenal (‘visuo-tactile’ à la Ayer, Strawson) property of the duck—but rather in the subject having some mental state of her own that represents the duck’s blueness, and from which she goes on to acquire the belief concerning the existence, swimming-ness, blueness, etc. of the blue duck. As such, the belief acquisition view can quite easily accommodate the Common Factor Principle from earlier: it can hold that despite the phenomenological indistinguishability of hallucinations from veridical perceptions, there is some underlying discriminant that accounts for the discontinuity between the Hallucination and Veridical cases on matters of perception: namely whether the thing the subject sees, F , is true or not. For if F is true and she believes it, she can be said to see it is true; but if F is false, then she will be simply be misled, or hallucinating. A \u0000\u0000nal motivating piece that must be mentioned whilst we are here: the natural meshing with evolutionary theory. (Presumably it is the case that) the dominant explanation in the biological sciences, and particularly in evolutionary biology, for the origin for perception (and thus, presumably, for consciousness to some extent arguably), is the competitive advantage of an organism to be able to acquire true beliefs about its environment, about its own state, and so on. And since belief acquisition theory, as the name suggests, so deeply embeds perception in terms of acquiring beliefs, there seems an at very minimum an theoretic aesthetic quality to the view that counts in its favour. If my speaking so highly of belief acquisition theory is correct, then this begs the question: why did I mention rejecting it in favour of tracking theory? To put it succinctly, it is because despite its attractive epistemology and appealing biological roots, I \u0000\u0000nd belief acquisition theory to be untenable. Some untenable commitments It is all very good saying that perception seems to always involve a belief of some kind or another, whether this be for epistemology’s or biology’s sake. But herein lies the problem, for seems to necessitate a\u0000\u0000\u0000rming also the inverse of this claim, i.e. that we don’t perceive things we don’t believe in. For if we held that we could perceive them, then we would no longer be belief acquisitionists. Yet there seem a variety of examples where, intuitively, this doesn’t seem to hold. Fish (2021, 47) notes the case of the famous Müller-Lyer illusion. Here, despite the lines being identical in length, we also seem to experience them to be di\u0000ferent lengths; even if we have seen the illusion countless times before, and even though we might be devout true believers in the lines’ equality in length. Doubtless, even Müller-Lyer had the same experience. Given the strength of this sensible experience we have, it seems wrong to deny it perception status. After all, we seem to be experiencing seeing the lines being di\u0000ferent lengths; we even believe that we are seeing them to be di\u0000ferent lengths. Alas, however the belief acquisitionist denies this to be a perception, as we don’t actually believe the lines are of di\u0000ferent length. One modi\u0000\u0000cation is presented. Rather than requiring strict acquisition, we might also permit cases where we have a strong inclination to believe, just we are suppressing it by virtue of knowing the lines are trying to mislead us. Yet this seems far from satisfying. The original allure was the simplicity of the account, and its clarity. We seem to abandon this bene\u0000\u0000t by modifying it this way. I will mention one \u0000\u0000nal response as suggested by Glüer (2009, 313–314); that of considering those beliefs associated with experiences as separate experiential beliefs, distinct from those regular ones. Here the trick is to point to supposedly di\u0000ferent contents of these sets of beliefs. Whilst regular old beliefs would still ascribe regular old properties, these experiential beliefs would refer to phenomenal properties, i.e. a belief that something looks blue, that the left line looks longer than the right one. It should be pretty clear how this might be supposed to help the belief acquisitionist. What can be said is this: this doesn’t look like belief acquisition anymore, but rather intentionality (see §5.1). The point being here is: why? If you want intentionality pick intentionalism, as we will see later. Or better yet, pick tracking representationalism. 5. Tracking representationalism Once again, it is my argument that an indirect representationalism is the correct solution to the problem of perception. But more speci\u0000\u0000cally, it is a tracking representationalism that I will seek to demonstrate gives us the best answers, and that avoids the pit falls of other views. Though I have so far outlined the basic premise and contours of the representationalist thesis—and of one promising alternative to my endorsement—a more intricate accounting of its logic, and especially of the tracking’s version, is warranted. Broadly, two features we can understood as integral to this certain species of representationalism I have mind; (1) its description of mental phenomena in terms of intentionality, and (2) its ‘tracking’. I posit that both of these represent in themselves substantial motivations for the view, and clear improvements over direct realism. In §5.3 however, I list a few more motivations that are relevant; such as its accommodation of physicalism, the transparency of experience, and meshing with empirical data. 5.1 Intentionality Tracking theory’s thesis is can be given as a conception of representationalism that holds that, in essence, every phenomenal property is identical to some intentional property. Intentionalism as a broader grouping is a brand of representationalism that construes of phenomena with reference to mental states, but more precisely in terms of the intentional content of mental states. To talk of the intentionality is to talk of a sort of ‘directedness’ or ‘aboutness’, speci\u0000\u0000cally with respect to the world. To have an an intentional property, then, is to be directed or about the world in a certain way. And those mental states that exhibit intentionality can be said to have intentional properties. We might recoil at the term ‘directedness’, given the not-so-\u0000\u0000attering depiction of direct realism I gave earlier. But, note, this is meant to evoke the notion of direction, and not the stricter sense of ‘being direct’ implicit in the immediacy of the direct realist thesis. What about intentionality gives us a path forward with perception and phenomena? The basic idea is this. Most mental states we have, did have, will have, or could possibly have, etc. exhibit this intentionality; that is they are directed at something. If I am hungry then they ‘direct’ In the same light, most perceptual states have intentions too. So under an intentionalist view, for me to perceive the a blue duck swimming cheerily in a pond, is for me to have a (mental) perceptual state, and that perceptual state to have an intentional content with regard to the blue duck. And the accounting of the phenomenal qualities of the duck are wrapped up neatly within this: the (intentional) content of my mental state is such that it directly represents the duck. By directly representing it, the phenomenal properties associated with it follow. But, crucially, for emphasis: this does not amount to a direct perception in the strict sense since it is not the duck directly that I am accessing for its phenomenal properties. Rather it is the direct representation of the duck. How do we avoid Hallucination? Very simply: we \u0000\u0000rst accept the Common Factor Principle and accept the two are phenomenologically indistinguishable. But we have built here an account explicating why V counts as perception and H doesn’t. The (theoretical) attitude I take towards the hallucinated object is fundamentally di\u0000ferent to the existent attitude I take in veridical cases. Since the intentionality property of my mental state is refers to being directed at something in the world, though not directly accessing, and being causally linked to that thing by my experiences; it follows that in the case of H, where there is no actual thing to be directed towards, there is no perception. 5.2 Tracking What makes tracking theory so unique though, given that intentionality is quite a broadly accepted thesis among representationalists? This is of course the tracking element of tracking theory: the notion that intentionality in some ways constitutes or is derived from a tracking relation. What this means then is intentionality is to be thought explicitly involving detecting information about and correlating information with the given context or environment. À la Lycan (1987; 1996), putting this all together, what this yields is a very neat theory of phenomenal properties indeed. By invoking intentional objects—by saying that the blue duck is represented as a mental state, in the form of an intentional object, with intentional properties—tracking theory not only lets us maintain that our associated experiences of phenomena are indeed properties of phenomenal objects, but it also lets us deny that these phenomenal objects are external to us, or our sense data. Since, any experiences or phenomena are to be understood as properties of these intentional objects. 5.3 Physicalism But tracking theory also has other bene\u0000\u0000ts. It meshes with the dominant consensus in the behavioural sciences and in psychology & neuroscience especially, where (very roughly) it is understood that, through di\u0000ferent parts of the brain operating on di\u0000ferent areas generate di\u0000ferent representations of the world that together come to create our uni\u0000\u0000ed conscious experience. (Need to check) Another note on the empirical side is the at least surface parallels to the way arti\u0000\u0000cial intelligence and machine learning programs can be understood to ‘perceive’: through passing data through layers upon layers (transformations) the create neural networks, that in e\u0000fect, give rise to a representation of the world that informs the output they generate. There is also the clear parallel with tracking: machine learning explicitly centres around the concept of ‘evolutions’ of iterations that, over time, learn by perceiving and perceive by learning. A \u0000\u0000nal feature, and hopefully a great motivator, is the comfortable couching of physicalism within the tracking theory. Recall in §1 my brief mentioning of three reasons to care about the puzzle of perception; one of those being the related ontological commitments it may or may not inform. So for those who embrace physicalism, this will represent a signi\u0000\u0000cant added bonus of the theory. 6. Conclusion My argument against the direct realist as given can be understood as dual-pronged. The \u0000\u0000rst half confronts direct realism, positing that it simply does not have anywhere near enough the explanatory power we would expect from an adequate theory of perception. The second half provides the alternative answer; that of representationalism to deal with Hallucination/Illusion problems. More speci\u0000\u0000cally, I advocated for a tracking theory of representationalism that not only seems to provide a neat and appealing theory of perception, but also couches with it a number of epistemological, ontological, and phenomenological bene\u0000\u0000ts.
