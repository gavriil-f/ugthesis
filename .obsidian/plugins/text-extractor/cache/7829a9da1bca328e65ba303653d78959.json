Gavriil Fakih MT 2023 1\tIntroduction Traditionally, knowledge, or the knowing of something, means having a true belief about something with justification. This classical analysis of knowledge fails, however, with so-called Gettier problems, showing justified true belief not to be sufficient for knowledge in all cases. Counterexamples can also be generated for more plausible alternative analyses of knowledge, such as the externalist Causal and Reliabilist theories. Knowledge may instead be unanalysable, that is to say it may be impossible to provide an airtight list of certain conditions for what it means to know something. 2\tThe classical account of knowledge For any person to know something, that thing must be true. I can’t know something that is false, that the sun is purple or that the Earth is flat, for example. If I know something, I also, presumably, have to believe it. It may be true that Montreal is in Quebec, but if I do not believe it, then I cannot be said to know it. But holding a true belief is not enough to count as knowledge. Suppose I believe, on no particular basis, that I will win the lottery tomorrow. If by chance I do, I will have held a true belief, but this cannot count as knowledge. Did I really know I would win? We need a third condition then, justification, to discount these lucky guesses. This is the classical analysis of knowledge, and can be formalised as the following: S knows P iff P is true S believes that P, and S is justified in believing that P. 3\tThe Gettier problem These conditions seem then to be necessary for knowledge. But, as pointed out by Gettier, they may not be sufficient. There may be cases when these conditions are not enough to say that we know something. Take the example of Jones trying to cheat in an exam by copying Smith’s answer on a multiple-choice question. Smith is much more studious than Jones and usually gets full marks in such exams, so Jones, looking over, would be justified in believing that the correct answer to the question is the one Smith put down. In an exceptional turn of events, however, Smith has forgotten to revise and, unbeknownst to Jones, simply guessing the answer for every question. As it so happens, however, Smith guesses correctly, and thus: The proposition that what Smith wrote down was the correct answer is true. Jones believed that what Smith wrote down was the correct answer. And Jones was justified in his belief since Smith is incredibly studious. This fits the conditions required by the classical analysis of knowledge but does not seem to take into account the fact that Jones was in some sense wrong (and not just for cheating). He believed that what Smith wrote down was the correct answer, he was justified in believing so, and it just so happened that it was true, but by sheer luck. Gettier problems like this suggest then that knowledge is something more than the simple sum of justification and true belief. Could we achieve a good analysis of knowledge then by maybe adding a fourth condition to this justified true belief (JTB)? We could eliminate the problem many Gettier cases, by perhaps demanding that we do not rely on any false beliefs to reach our conclusion. A man who happens to tell the right time from a stopped clock relies on the false belief that the clock is working, and in the exam case Jones relied on the false belief that Smith had indeed revised. Any justified true beliefs arrived at by reliance on any false beliefs along the way should not count as knowledge according to this no-false belief hypothesis. However, we can show such an analysis is too strict and simply cuts out too much perfectly good knowledge. Taking an example from Nagel, suppose a detective has plenty of reliable evidence to justify a (true) belief that Alice assaulted Bob. There are a dozen reliable witnesses, DNA evidence and even Alice’s confession. Unbeknownst to the detective however, one of the witnesses is lying, and did not in fact see Alice nor Bob that fateful day. The detective has inferred her true conclusion then from her false belief that all the witnesses are telling the truth. This theory should be discounted then if we want to accept the common-sense view that we can indeed gain knowledge despite the presence of some false beliefs along the way, as long as our overall justification is strong enough. There are come backs to this lying witness counterexample Actually I reckon the basic belief that is Gettiered (eg Goldman’s sheep) is more powerful. Sections 2 and 3 Very nice and clear and a level of explanation that is very welcome in year 1. but you can be briefer on this sort of material for FHS. You want to get to the material that will show off your knowledge of the topic and reasoning skills. This so far is not getting you above a 2:2 for FHS, no matter how clear and faultless. 4\tThe causal theory of knowledge To solve the problem caused by Gettier cases, Goldman proposes a causal theory of knowledge. Experience-based knowledge requires the knower to be appropriately causally connected to a fact. Knowing a fact then is a matter of having a belief that is caused by that very fact. If a man looks at a stopped clock that just so happens to be currently telling the correct time, there is a causal disconnect between what the time really is and the what the clock is displaying. Similarly Smith’s correct guess is not causally connected to whatever the answer to the question really is, and so there is no causal link between Jones’ true belief and the fact of the matter. Comparing this with our normal perception of the world, we can see the causal theory in action. If I see that there is a laptop in front of me, it is because there are light rays bouncing off the laptop and into my eyes, causing me to visually perceive it in front of me. The fact that the laptop is there plays a key role in the formation of my belief. As long as there is a causal chain to be found between a fact and the formation of a subject’s belief, then it can count as knowledge. The causal analysis differs to JTB in dropping the justification condition. I may know that Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, but I may not remember how I came to know it. If challenged, I may not even be able to provide justification for my belief, but for Goldman this still counts as knowing as long as there is a causal chain linking my belief with the fact. The well-known fake barn example seems to stop the causal theory in its tracks, however. The example goes like so: Henry is driving in the countryside and sees a barn. Ordinarily, we would say that Henry knows that what he sees is a barn, but unknown to him he is driving through Fake Barn County. For every real barn, the locals have, for whatever reason, decided to build three fake barn façades throughout the county. Henry is simply fortunate in that what he sees is one of the real barns. Much like Jones luckily stumbled to the correct answer, Henry was just lucky that he happened to be looking at one of the real barns. Even though there is in fact a real barn that is causing him to form his belief in the normal perceptual way, he does not seem to know that what he is looking at is a real barn when we consider all the fake barn façades around. All very clear and well reasoned. Fine to be briefer. 5\tReliabilism The problem may be that Henry has formed his belief in an unreliable way. Even if he can generally trust his eyesight, and in any other scenario his belief in the barn would be reliable, his visual perception is unreliable in Fake Barn County as it likely to generate a false belief. A potential solution to this problem is amending the causal theory in favour of a reliabilist approach. This can be formalised as: S knows P iff S has a true belief that P, formed by a reliable belief-forming process. As long as it is likely to deliver the truth for the subject in their current environment, a belief-forming process can be deemed reliable. So even if Henry is not aware, his normal sensory perceptions are not reliable in Fake Barn County, thus his true causal belief cannot count as knowledge. But the reliabilist theory runs into problems of its own. Suppose I have a lottery ticket. If I, as a pessimist, am sure that I will not win on the basis of incredibly low odds, I am 99.9999% likely to be right, which suggests incredibly high reliability. Suppose I am proven right, did I really know all along I would not win? Sticking with the reliabilist theory would suggest I somehow did, even though our intuition would tell us otherwise. I wouldn’t say it’s the worst problem for the reliabilist but it’s fine and well explained. 5\tIs knowledge even analysable? So far, I have shown that many theories of knowledge are open to counterexamples that undermine them, as they seem to generate counterintuitive results. Perhaps, then knowledge cannot be analysed as true belief plus some other ingredients. As Zagzebski argues, if knowledge = true belief + X, and X incorporates the idea of knowledge, then the argument is circular. If X guarantees instead the truth of the belief, then there is also a redundancy. And whilst JTB is neither circular nor redundant, Zagzebski showed that Gettier-like counterexamples can be generated for any analysis of knowledge that incorporates true belief plus something else as ingredients. look at Williamson and Blome-Tillman ways of criticising analysis We have been operating under the assumption that because knowledge entails belief, knowledge is a compound of believing plus some other factors. But perhaps knowledge is more primitive than belief. Good. Consider the analogy of a geometrically perfect circle and the more common every-day property of being rounded. Roundedness is an approximation of a circle, and any circle is rounded, much like belief can be viewed as an approximation of knowledge and to know something implies believing in it. As Williamson points out, to believe in something is to treat it as if you know it, so belief can be viewed as a secondary concept. Much more on this. 6\tConclusion Reductive analyses of knowledge are open to counterexamples that generate counterintuitive results. If instead we view knowledge as a fundamental basic concept, then we find that reductive analysis of it is impossible. Knowledge can thus be seen not as a compound of true belief but the most basic standard to aim for when choosing what to believe in. You write very well and I would have been delighted with this as your first essay because you understand well all the Prelims reading. it was clear you hadn’t read the required finals level reading, or at least, not carefully enough to be able to write about it confidently. That wasn’t because you couldn’t understand the ideas in it I think. You explained you have trouble concentrating and keeping at work, especially with more difficult texts. You were a delight in the tutorial itself - you think on your feet fast and are willing to keep going back and trying another idea. You are intellectually curious, flexible and humble without being diffident. So you just need to find a way to transfer your skills of concentration and intellectual grit from verbal discussion to reading alone. You also need to be doing less than three papers a term. I’m confident both things can be done.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
