You will therefore have to give up p1/ p2 units of хо т order to do this (e.g. if po = Е2 you have to give up £1/£2 = 05 units of x2). e The slope of the budget line therefore measures the cost of having more оЁ ху in terms of the amount of x2 foregone (i.e. the opportunity cost).","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+fra+rus"}
