How did this happen? “Hockey-stick” curves represent the sustained rapid growth in GDP per capita - Gross Domestic Product (GDP): A measure of total income and output of the economy in a given period. Usually expressed in per-capita terms (as an average income). - Note: GDP per capita ≠ Disposable income - Disposable income = Total income – taxes + government transfers - Note: Both are (very) imperfect measures of well-being Economic growth in the modern eraEconomic growth in the modern eraTiming of growth in the modern era The growth take-off occurred at different points in time for different countries: • Britain was the first country to experience sustained economic growth. It began around 1650. • In Japan, it occurred around 1870. • The kink for China and India happened in the second half of the 20th century. In some economies, substantial improvements in people’s living standards did not occur until they gained independence from colonial rule or interference by European nations. The Capitalist Revolution Capitalism led to growth in living standards because of: • impact on technology: firms competing in markets had strong incentives to adopt and develop new technologies • specialization: the growth of firms and the expansion of markets linking the entire world allowed historically unprecedented specialization in tasks and production Together with the technological revolution, this increased worker productivity. Specialization and Trade Specialization increases productivity of labour because we become better at producing things when we each focus on a limited range of activities • learning by doing • taking advantage of natural differences in skill and talent • economies of scale (See the classic Adam Smith passage from Wealth of Nations on the division of labour in a pin factory). People can only specialize if they have a way to acquire the other goods they need. In a capitalist society, this is done via markets. Specialization and International Trade More generally, countries (or economies) can also gain from specialization and international trade. The essential idea concerns the principles of absolute advantage and comparative advantage - the gains from trade follow from allowing an economy to specialize. Trade Under these circumstances he argued that trade was mutually beneficial. \"If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage. \" (Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book IV, Section ii, 12) The Production Possibility Frontier Typically PPF’s will be concave toward the origin - the MRT gets steeper. This is because many productive activities involved diminishing marginal returns. For example if you are picking fruit you go for the low hanging fruit first. Higher fruit will involve more resources (ladders, nets) so the returns to marginal increases in fruit- gathering drop (you get fewer fruit per hour).
