In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. Oligopolies: Collusion There are n firms in an industry and they have identical cost functions c(qk) = 2qk, k = 1, 2, . . . , n; the inverse demand function in the industry is p(q) = 10 − q, where q = ∑n k=1 qk. (a) If n = 1, i.e. there is a monopolist, what is the profit maximising quantity, qM , what will be the resulting price, pM , and how much profit, πM , will the firm make in each period? Now consider the case n > 1, with the firms having the same discount factor δ < 1. The firms interact over an infinite number of periods, and attempt to collude. (b) Price setting Each of them considers playing the following trigger strategy: charge pM in each period (the resulting market quantity being determined by demand) as long as all the other firms have done so in the past; if any firm deviates, then charge marginal cost for evermore. If each of them adopts the above strategy, what is the upper limit on the amount of profit that any one firm could make in the period it deviated? What is the amount of profit that that firm would make in each period of the punishment phase? How large does δ have to be for these trigger strategies to constitute a subgame perfect equilibrium in which collusion is sustained? (c) Quantity setting As an alternative, each of them considers playing the following trigger strategy: supply qM /n in each period (the resulting market price being determined by demand) as long as all the other firms have done so in the past; if any firm deviates, then supply the ‘Cournot quantity’ for evermore. If each of them adopts the above strategy, show that maximum profit that any one firm could make in the period it deviated is 4(1 + 1 n ) 2. What is the amount of profit that that firm would make in each period of the punishment phase? When n = 2, how large does δ have to be for these trigger strategies to constitute a subgame perfect equilibrium in which collusion is sustained? What if n = 3? (d) Hence show that when n = 2 there are values of δ for which collusion is sustainable in the price-setting game of part (b) but not in the quantity-setting game of part (c), and that when n = 3 this conclusion is reversed. Briefly comment. 1 2. Oligopolies: Simultaneous vs. Sequential Consider a duopoly, with two firms producing goods that are perfect substitutes; they play a quantity-setting game for one period only. The firms differ in their cost functions: the total cost to firm k of producing a quantity qk is ckqk, for k = 1, 2. The inverse demand function in the market is p(q) = a − q where q = q1 + q2. Assume that the firms move simultaneously. (a) Derive the best response function (reaction curve) of each firm, confirming that firm 2’s best response function is q2(q1) = 1 2(a − c2 − q1). Hence find the Nash equilibrium of the game, showing that, in equilibrium, firm 2 produces a quantity qC 2 = 1 3(a − 2c2 + c1). (Note: You may assume that the reaction curves intersect at positive quantities.) (b) Show that firm 1’s equilibrium profit, πC 1 , is given by πC 1 (qC 1 , qC 2 ) = (a − qC 1 − qC 2 − c1) qC 1 . Hence show that a marginal change in its own cost parameter, c1, affects its profit through three channels: (i) the direct effect of the change in its own costs, (ii) an indirect effect via the change in its own quantity, and (iii) a second indirect effect via the change in the other firm’s quantity. Explain why the indirect effect via the marginal change in its own quantity is 0. Hence show that the total effect of the change is dπC 1 /dc1 = − 4 3 qC 1 . Similarly, find the effect on firm 1’s profit of a marginal change in the other firm’s cost parameter, c2. Which of the three effects are zero in this case? Is the size of the change in firm 1’s profit greater when its own cost changes, or when the other firm’s cost changes? Why? Now assume that the firms move sequentially, firm 1 first. (c) Will firm 1’s equilibrium quantity be larger or smaller than qC 1 ? Why? What quantity, qS 1 , will firm 1 choose? What will be firm 2’s response, qS 2 ? (d) Which firm would the consumers prefer to move first, the one with the lower cost or the one with the higher cost? 2 3. Oligopolies: Horizontal/Vertical Differentiation and Merging Suppose that two firms produce horizontally differentiated products. The firms com- pete for a single period and choose prices simultaneously. Each firm has the same constant marginal cost of production c ≥ 0, and fixed costs are zero. The linear demand functions are given by: q1(p1, p2) = 100 − αp1 + βp2 q2(p1, p2) = 100 − αp2 + βp1. Assume that α > β > 0 and that 100 > αc. (a) Explain the difference between horizontally differentiated and vertically differ- entiated products, giving examples of each. Explain why the demand functions above represent horizontally differentiated products. (b) Show that the symmetric pure-strategy Bertrand-Nash equilibrium prices are: p∗ i = p∗ j = 100+αc 2α−β . Find the corresponding quantities, and check that the prices and quantities are positive at the equilibrium. (c) Show how the equilibrium prices change in the parameters α, β and c. Provide a brief economic explanation of these comparative statics results. (d) Suppose now that the two firms merge. The new firm acts as a monopolist, choos- ing p1 and p2. Find the profit-maximizing price assuming that the monopolist sets the same price for both products, that is p1 = p2. Is this price higher or lower than the equilibrium price from part (b)? 3 4. Monopolies: Entry Deterrence Consider a market in which firm 1 is an incumbent and firm 2 is a potential entrant. The total cost to firm 1 of producing a quantity q1 is 2q1, whereas the total cost to firm 2 of entering then producing a quantity q2 is F + 4q2, where F ≥ 0 is its fixed cost of entry. The inverse demand function in the market is p(q) = 40 − q where q = q1 + q2. Assume that the firms move sequentially, firm 1 first: firm 1 chooses its quantity, q1, observed by firm 2; firm 2 then decides whether or not to enter the market, and, if it does so, it chooses its quantity, q2. (Assume that firm 2 enters the market only if it makes a strictly positive profit.) (a) Suppose that the fixed cost of entry, F , is zero, and firm 2 has entered the market. Confirm that firm 2’s best response function is q2(q1) = 1 2(36 − q1). What quantity will firm 1 choose? How much profit will each firm make? (b) Suppose that the fixed cost of entry is low, F = 4. What choices of quantity by firm 1 would deter entry, and what is the most profit it would make by doing so? What quantity will firm 1 choose, and what will be firm 2’s subsequent decisions? (c) Suppose that the fixed cost of entry is medium, F = 36. What quantity will firm 1 now choose, and what will be firm 2’s subsequent response? (d) Suppose that the fixed cost of entry is high, F = 100. Again, what quantity will firm 1 now choose, and what will be firm 2’s subsequent response? (e) Comment on the different outcomes in parts (b)–(d), paying particular attention to the last two. 4 Essay-style Questions 1. To what extent does analysing the interaction between firms as a one-shot game, or a repeated one-shot game, help our understanding of firms’ behaviour? 2. “Whether price or quantity is the strategic variable matters when analysing one-shot oligopoly interaction. The choice of strategic variables matters far less when one con- siders repeated interaction.” Discuss. 3. “Bertrand had the right assumptions but the wrong conclusions. Cournot had the wrong assumptions but the right conclusions.” Discuss. 4. What does it mean for a Nash equilibrium to be subgame perfect? Explain the role of subgame perfection either in a model of collusion or in a model of entry. 5. Is collusion more likely in an industry where price is the strategic variable or where price is the strategic variable? Does your answer depend on the number of firms in- volved? 6. How is the likelihood of collusion affected by: the rate at which future profits are discounted, the number of firms, size inequality between firms, the economic cycle? 7. Suppose that in an industry there are currently at least two firms that sell identical products, and that they are earning collusive profits. What will be the likely effects on the ability to maintain collusion of: (a) an increase in the number of firms; (b) a rise in the real interest rate; (c) an anticipated one-period increase in industry demand; and (d) the introduction of a leniency programme? (Consider each factor separately.) 8. Should competition authorities try to deter collusion among firms? What policies could be used to reduce the amount of collusion in a market? 9. How can the competition authorities detect collusion? How can they deter it? 10. A group living on an off-shore island is facing a possible attack. If left in peace, the islanders get a payoff of 6 and the potential attackers get 3. If the islanders are attacked, they can either stay & fight or run to the mainland; if they fight, then they 5 get 2 as do the attackers; if they run away, they get 3 and the attackers get 4. Should the attackers leave the islanders in peace? Should the islanders fight if attacked? Prior to any attack, one of the islanders suggests that they burn the bridge to the mainland - this reduces the payoff from running away from an attack to 1. Should the islanders burn the bridge? What should the attackers do now? How is this fable applicable to a model of strategic entry deterrence? 11. How can firms strategically deter entry? In what circumstances are they likely to do better by accommodating entry? 12. How might a firm use quantities or prices to deter entry of other firms or induce exit of other firms in an industry? Evaluate, using examples, the remedies available to the authorities when such anti-competitive behaviour has been found. 13. Are horizontal mergers good only if they lower marginal cost? 14. Explain how horizontal mergers can raise prices and lower consumer surplus. Why should horizontal mergers ever be allowed? 15. Is current merger policy too permissive? 16. What, if anything, do market shares say about market power? 17. “The most serious problem facing competition authorities is usually one of market definition.” Do you agree? Illustrate your answer with reference to at least two cases. 18. What are the proper objectives of competition policy? 19. Do the information requirements of competition policy seriously limit its effectiveness? Illustrate your answer by reference to specific cases. 20. To what extent should competition law enforcement depend on the assessment of the motives underlying firms’ behaviour? 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
