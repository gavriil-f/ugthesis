Under the Capital Cash Flow (CCF) valuation approach, the value of the levered firm equals the discounted value of total cash flows, C + TS discounted at the firm’s unlevered cost of capital, rU . Recall that C represents unlevered cash flows and TS represents the tax shield. Assume that both levered firm value and unlevered (i.e. operating cash flows) are martingales, i.e., Et [V L t+1] = V L t and Et [Ct+1] = Ct [The martingale assumption is not necessary but it does avoid using a lot of summation symbols and a proof by mathematical induction.] a. Show that CCF Valuation is equivalent to WACC valuation. Hints: (i) Both WACC and CCF valuation assume that the firm follows the constant ratio policy, so the tax shield is proportional to value of the levered firm. Also note that the CCF valuation equation can expressed recursively as follows: V L t = ( 1 1 + rU ) Et    Total CF @ t+1 ︷ ︸︸ ︷ Ct+1 + TSt+1 + Value @ t+1 ︷︸︸︷ V L t+1    b. Under both WACC and CCF valuation, the required return on the levered firm equals rU irrespective of the firm’s capital structure. Thus, MM proposition II holds. Does MM Proposition I hold? Why or why not? c. Why is the assumption that the firm follows a constant ratio policy crucial for WACC/CCF valuation. 2. Andrade and Kaplan (1998) estimated the cost of financial distress using a particular estimation approach. What do you think of their approach? Are there any features of their approach that are problematic and might have substantial effects on their estimates. 3. Over the last 10 years, the fraction of firm value attributable to intangible capital (IT capital, reputation capital, intellectual capital etc.) has greatly increased (e.g. Crouzet & Eberly, 2021). At the same time corporate leverage ratios have, on average, also increased (Abraham, Lorente, & Schmukler, 2020). Do these two trends pose a challenge to the trade-off theory of capital structure?
