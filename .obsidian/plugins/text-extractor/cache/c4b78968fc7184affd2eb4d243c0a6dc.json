In general there are too many questions for students to tackle in a single week. Tutors will decide which of these questions their students should do in preparation for the tutorial or class. Problems and Multipart Questions 1. Preferences over Lotteries Lucy’s behaviour over monetary (wealth) lotteries is easy to describe. The utility of any lottery is equal to the largest prize that has a strictly positive probability of happening. That is, Lucy believes that she is “luc(k)y” and that, no matter the probabilities, she will win the largest possible possible prize in any lottery. (a) Prove that completeness and transitivity hold and, hence, that Lucy’s behavior is rational. (b) Discuss whether continuity and independence hold. Is Lucy an expected utility maximizer? (c) How is Lucy’s risk premium? 2. Eliciting your own Behavior (There is no ‘correct’ answer to this question – your answer will depend on your own attitude to risk). You will be expressing your preferences for coin-ﬂip gambles with two possible pay- outs and equal probability, [ 1 2, 1 2; x, y]. First, write down what your certainty equiv- alent (CE) would be for the gamble [ 1 2, 1 2; 0, 1000] and call this amount c. Second, consider the gambles [ 1 2, 1 2; 0, c] and [ 1 2, 1 2; c, 1000] and write down your CEs for these two gambles. If you are an expected utility individual, what have you learnt about your monetary utility? Can you draw it? (You need to think carefully about your CEs – what would you choose if you were really oﬀered these gambles. See Kreps 3.6 for discussion of this kind of exercise.) 3. An Investment Problem Charlie is an expected utility maximiser, with utility function u(y) = ln y over ﬁnal wealth y. Assume that his initial wealth is 10. (a) Show that Charlie is risk-averse. (b) Compute Charlie’s Absolute and Relative Measures of Risk Aversion. He has the opportunity to invest an amount c > 0 in a risky project: with probability 1 2 it succeeds and he gets back his investment plus a proﬁt of c; with probability 1 2 it fails and he gets back only half of what he invested (thus making a loss). (c) What is his ﬁnal wealth if he invests and the project is a success? What is his ﬁnal wealth if he invests and the project is a failure? Write down the expression for his expected utility, as a function of the investment level c. What investment level c will he choose? (d) How much would he invest if his initial wealth was 20? Explain. 1 4. An Insurance Problem Perdita is a risk averse expected utility maximiser. Her initial wealth is w and her preferences over monetary outcomes, y, are summarised by the utility function u(y). She is living in uncertain times – she might incur a loss of L > 0, or she might lose nothing at all. The loss occurs with probability π, but insurance is available at a cost of pq for an amount q of cover, i.e. she can pay a premium of pq and, in the event of a loss, she will receive a reimbursement of q. (a) What can you say about the signs of u ′ and u ′′? What does this imply for the comparison of u′(w − L) with u ′(w)? (b) Brieﬂy explain why the case in which p = π is called actuarially fair. (c) When the amount of insurance cover she buys is q, what is her expected utility? Show that the ﬁrst-order condition for her optimal choice, q∗, is π(1 − p) u ′ (w − L + (1 − p)q∗) − (1 − π)p u ′ (w − pq∗) = 0 . (d) By using the FOC, or otherwise, show that when the insurance premium is actu- arially fair she will fully insure, i.e. p = π ⇒ q∗ = L. (e) What if p > π? 5. Stochastic Dominance Tom is an expected utility maximizer with utility function over wealth described by function u. Tom is a thief, and currently faces the following situation: after having committed a robbery, his wealth is w, but with probability p, he is going to be caught and ﬁned an amount f . (a) Write the expected utility of the lottery that Tom is facing. The authorities plan to increase the expected amount Tom pays from pf to 1.01 pf , by either (a) increasing p by 1% to 1.01 p, or (b) increasing f by 1% to 1.01 f . (b) Sketch the CDF of the outcomes resulting from (a) and from (b). (c) Hence or otherwise, determine which is the greater deterrent when Tom is risk averse – the 1% increase in p or the 1% increase in f . 2 6. Continuous Distributions (a) The outcomes of lottery La are uniformly distributed on the unit interval, that is, the associated pdf f (x) takes the value 1 on [0, 1], and 0 elsewhere. What is the mean outcome, µa? Prove that the variance of the outcomes, σ2 a, is 1 12. (b) Consider another function g(x) that takes the value c(x − 1 2)2 on [0, 1], and 0 elsewhere. What value of c ensures that g is a pdf, that is, ∫ 1 0 g(x) dx = 1? What is the mean outcome of the lottery Lb whose outcomes are distributed according to the pdf g(x)? What is the variance of the outcomes of this lottery? (c) Show that lottery Lb is a mean-preserving spread of lottery La. (Compare the two pdfs, f (x) and g(x), graphically.) (d) The CDF of f (x) is F (X) = X, 0 ≤ X ≤ 1. Calculate the CDF, G(X) = Pr[x ≤ X], associated with g(x). Sketch these two CDFs and conﬁrm that lottery La second-order stochastically dominates lottery Lb. (e) Does one of the lotteries La and Lb ﬁrst-order stochastically dominate the other? 7. Bilateral Insurance Contracts Arthur is risk averse, and his income tomorrow depends on which of two possible states occurs; each state is equally likely. His income will be 8 if state 1 occurs, but only 2 if state 2 occurs. (a) Draw Arthur’s indiﬀerence curves in state-contingent income space, and explain how he could be better oﬀ if he were able to buy insurance. Norma is risk neutral. Her income will be 3 if state 1 occurs, and 7 if state 2 occurs. Suppose that they can write contracts of the form “Arthur will give Norma an amount x if and only if state 1 occurs, and Norma will give Arthur an amount y if and only if state 2 occurs.” (b) What shape are Norma’s indiﬀerence curves? From Arthur’s point of view, what is the best contract that Norma would ﬁnd acceptable, and why? Now assume that Arthur’s utility as a function of his income m is ln m. (c) From Norma’s point of view, what is the best contract that Arthur would ﬁnd acceptable? (d) Illustrate your results from part (b) and part (c) in an Edgeworth box, and highlight the set of eﬃcient risk-sharing contracts. 3 8. Risk Pooling (a) Deﬁne the certainty equivalent of a lottery. How can it be used to determine whether or not someone should participate in a lottery? (b) Sam and Janet are risk averse, each deriving utility ln w from ﬁnal wealth w. There is a lottery that would leave Sam with ﬁnal wealth of either 5 or 20, each equally likely; there is a second lottery that would leave Janet with ﬁnal wealth of either 4 or 25, again each equally likely. If Sam and Janet have the same initial wealth, explain why they would either both accept, or both decline, their separate gambles. From now on, assume that they each have initial wealth 12. (c) If the two lotteries are independent, would you advise them to each participate in their lottery, and share the costs and proceeds equally? (d) If the two lotteries are perfectly negatively correlated, why would you advise them to each participate in their lottery (again sharing the costs and proceeds equally), even if they were both much more risk averse? 9. Risk Pooling and Risk Sharing I (a) Bill’s initial wealth is 22. He can invest it all in a risky project that has a 50:50 chance of succeeding. If he invests and the project succeeds, his ﬁnal wealth will be 40, but if it fails, his ﬁnal wealth will be 10. Bill’s preferences over monetary outcomes, y, are summarised by the utility function u(y) = ln y. For him, what is the certainty equivalent of this project? What is the risk premium? Why should he reject the opportunity to invest in the project? (b) Ben has the same preferences and initial wealth as Bill, and suggests to him that they each invest 11 in the project and divide the proceeds equally, each ending with his remaining wealth plus either 40/2 after a success or 10/2 after a failure. Should Bill accept this oﬀer to share the risk? (c) Ben now ﬁnds an opportunity of his own to invest in a project with the same characteristics as Bill’s. (The success or failure of one project is independent of that of the other.) Obviously he wouldn’t do it on his own, but they could agree that each of them take on their project and then divide the proceeds equally between them. Should they pool their risks and invest in the projects? (d) If things were scaled up, so that the project payoﬀs became 400 or 100, and initial wealth was 220, would their choices change? Why? 4 10. Risk Pooling and Risk Sharing II Janet has CARA preferences. She has initial wealth w and is oﬀered the opportunity to buy a lottery ticket. If she buys it, her ﬁnal wealth will be either w + 4 or w − 2, each equally likely. She is indiﬀerent between buying the ticket and not buying it. (a) Explain whether she is risk averse, risk neutral, or risk loving. Draw this situation in state-contingent income space, with the ‘good’ outcome on the horizontal axis and the ‘bad’ outcome on the vertical axis. (b) She oﬀers her friend Sam (who has the same initial wealth and preferences as she does) the following proposition: they buy the ticket together, and share the cost and proceeds equally. Should Sam accept? Illustrate your answer in a diagram. (c) Sam has another idea: they buy two tickets (whose outcomes are independent), again sharing the costs and proceeds equally. Is this better than buying no tickets? Essay-style Questions 1. Is there a diﬀerence between risk and uncertainty? 2. “Maximising expected utility is the reasonable thing to do when facing choices with risky outcomes.” Why? 3. “Someone who plays the lottery and has motor insurance but not house insurance cannot be an Expected Utility maximiser.” Discuss. 4. Why is expected utility theory useful? 5. When does expected utility theory provide a good explanation of behaviour in the presence of risk? 6. Jim is indiﬀerent between retaining his current wealth and investing in a risky project that might make a high, medium, or low return. How might his attitude change if: (a) his current wealth increases? (b) the probability of the high return increases and the probability of the low return decreases by the same amount? (c) the probability of the high and low returns both increase by the same amount? 5 7. What determines the amount of insurance demanded by consumers? 8. “If everyone in an economy had the same level of wealth and the same attitude to risk, then there would be no scope for insurance.” Do you agree? 9. In the context of Expected Utility Theory, how is risk aversion represented and how is it measured? 10. Would you expect people to become more, or less, risk-averse when they get wealthier? 11. Sam is less risk averse than Janet. Explain what is meant by this, and, in particular, describe what diﬀerences we might observe between their behaviour when they are oﬀered the opportunity to participate in identical lotteries. Now suppose Sam and Janet have the same initial wealth, and that Sam is indiﬀerent between lottery A and lottery B, whereas Janet prefers lottery A to lottery B. Does it follow that lottery A is less risky than lottery B? 12. Sam prefers lottery A to lottery B, whereas Janet prefers lottery B to lottery A. Are these preferences consistent with both Sam and Janet being expected utility max- imisers? If so, can you determine whether or not either of the lotteries A and B stochastically dominates the other? Does your answer depend on Sam’s and Janet’s attitudes to risk? 13. Explain the following statements: “James is more risk averse than John.” “Lottery A is more favourable than Lottery B.” 14. Sam and Janet are risk averse, and in fact have identical preferences. Sam can invest only in risky project A, and is willing to do so. Janet can invest only in risky project B; she is also willing to do so, but would prefer Sam’s (project A). She proposes to Sam that they take on their separate projects but then share the payoﬀs. Under what circumstances, if any, would Sam accept, and under what circumstances would Sam decline? 15. After train crashes there is public outcry; after car crashes there is public apathy. Can this observation be reconciled with Expected Utility Theory? 16. Pat argues, “Sure, I don’t like risk. But if I always choose the option with the higher expected value, over the long run the wins and losses will more or less cancel out, except that I will end up getting a higher payoﬀ on average. So it is irrational to be averse to risk.” Evaluate Pat’s argument. 6","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
