Consumption efficiency (a) To lie on the contract curve, the allocation must be Pareto efficient. To be Pareto efficient, the consumers must have the same MRS. Finding MRS: δua δxa = 4 5xa δua δya = 1 5ya ∴ |MRSa| = 4ya xa δub δxb = 1 2xb δub δyb = 1 2yb ∴ |MRSb| = yb xa At the proposed allocation (xa = 5, ya = 5) (xb = 5, yb = 5) MRSa = 4 and MRSb = 1, thus it does not lie on the contract curve. (b) MRSa = 4ya 5 , MRSb = yb 5 . ya + yb = 10 ya = 10 − yb To be Pareto efficient, MRSa = MRSb, thus: 4ya 5 = 10 − ya 5 ya = 2 ∴ yb = 8 1 (c) 4ya xa = yb xa Rewrite in terms of xa and ya: 4ya xa = (10 − ya) (10 − xa) Rearranging gives: ya = 10xa 40 − 3xa (d) 0 10 0 10 (5, 5) xaya 4. Production Efficiency and Second Welfare Theorem (a) Given the following: u(x, y) = ln x + ln y Total supply of x = 48 Y = X 1 2 MRS: MRS = | − MUx MUy = y x 2 MRT: MRT = d dX (Y = X 1/2) = 1 2 X −1/2 = 1 2 √X (b) Pareto efficient allocation occurs when MRS = MRT and the endowment is exhausted. 48 − 32 = 16 → 161/2 = 4 ∴ endowment exhausted. MRS(32,4) = 1 8 = 0.1 (1d.p.) MRT(32,4) = 1 2√32 = 0.08838... = 0.1 (1d.p.) Hence, allocation of (x = 32, y = 4) is efficient. (c) To be a competitive equilibrium MRS = MRT = px py . Required relative price ρ must then be 1 8 . Normalising the price of good y to 1 gives: π = 32( 1 8 ) + 4 − 48( 1 8 ) = 2 Consumer expenditure is py · Y = 4. Consumer income is: 3 = px · X + π = 16( 1 8 ) + 2 = 4 Consumer expenditure ≯ consumer income ∴ budget constraint is satisfied. (d) 0 32 48 0 4 6.93 PPF u(x, y) (32, 4) xy 5. Welfare theorems (a) Given the following: u a(xa 1, x a 2) = 2 ln xa 1 + 3 ln xa 2 and u b(xb 1, x b 2) = 2 ln xb 1 + ln xb 2 Total of good 1 = 20 and total of good 2 = 12. Find Pareto efficient allocations by setting MRSa = MRSb ⇐⇒ 2x a 2 3xa 1 = 2xb 2 xb 1 . Using resource constraints: 2xa 2 3xa 1 = 2(12 − xa 2) 20 − xa 1 With some rearranging this yields: xa 2 = 18x a 1 10+xa 1 (b) Allocation of competitive equilibrium: xa 1 = 8, xa 2 = 8, xb 1 = 12 and xb 2 = 4. Substituting these 4 values into the equation found in (a): LHS = 8, RHS = 18(8) 10+8 = 8. LHS = RHS and the allocation exhausts endowments ∴ it is Pareto efficient. (c) Using equation in (a), LHS = 6, RHS = 18(5) 10+5 = 6, so it lies on the contract curve. xa 1 + xb 1 = 5 + 15 = 20 and xa 2 + xb 2 = 6 + 6 = 12, so it exhausts endowments. Hence it is Pareto efficient. MRSa = MRSb = ρ. ρ must therefore equal 2xa 2 3xa 1 which in this case = 2(6) 3(5) = 4 5 (d) To get from (wa 1 ) to (5, 6), consumer a must be willing to trade (wa 1 − 5) units of good 1 for 6 units of good 2. Using ρ found in (c), will trade when 4(wa 1 − 5) = 5 · 6, thus wa 1 should = 12.5. The social planner should therefore transfer 20 − 12.5 = 7.5 of good 1 from a to b. 4 5 ( 5","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
