This paper contains twenty questions. Answer THREE questions. There is a word limit of 1,600 words per answer. A12693W1 2 1. ‘Gettier cases force us to choose between (a) accepting that knowledge requires infallible justification of a kind we almost never have and (b) accepting that some beliefs amount to knowledge simply by luck.’ Do they? If so, which should we choose? 2. What philosophical problems, if any, would a successful analysis of knowledge help us solve? 3. ‘Since we still need an explanation for how we can “know” by ordinary standards, epistemic contextualism is no help in responding to scepticism.’ Is this a fair complaint? 4. EITHER (a) What sort of a proof would be needed to establish the existence of the external world? Is such a proof possible? OR (b) Can your hand experiences be evidence that you have hands if you have no prior reason to think that you are not a brain in a vat? 5. What does the argument from illusion establish, if anything? 6. ‘It is not possible to wrong someone epistemically; one can only be morally wronged in an epistemic context. Therefore, a specifically epistemic form of injustice does not exist.’ Is this a good argument against the existence of epistemic injustice? 7. Ann knows that exactly one of Jake (a man) and Barbara (a woman) stole her phone, and that the vast majority of phone thefts are committed by men. If she has no other relevant information, would she be epistemically justified in concluding that it was Jake who stole her phone? 8. Is there an inductive justification of induction that is not viciously circular? 9. EITHER (a) How much, if any, of our a priori knowledge can be explained by our mastery of concepts? OR (b) ‘A priori knowledge is not possible unless thought-processes are reliable, but the only way to establish the reliability of thought-processes is by empirical investigation; therefore, a priori knowledge is not possible.’ Discuss. A12693W1 3 LAST PAGE 10. If two objects occupy the same place at the same time, must they share all their parts at that time? If so, does this mean that no two objects can occupy the same place at the same time? 11. Is there a true but non-trivial version of the Identity of Indiscernibles? 12. Is time real? 13. If every truth has a truthmaker, what are the truthmakers of negative truths? 14. ‘Change is not inconsistent with things having incompatible properties at different times, nor does it entail that things must have incompatible properties at the same time; therefore, there is no problem of change’. Discuss. 15. Can qualitative identity be accounted for entirely in terms of resemblance? 16. Does the metaphysician need the relation of grounding over and above the relation of supervenience? 17. ‘Composite things are explanatorily redundant; therefore no things compose any thing.’ Discuss. 18. Is there a best account of persistence over time? If so, what is it? 19. What are possible worlds? How do they help, if they do, in accounting for modality? 20. ‘Race isn't real. Hence, anti-racist politics is doomed.’ Discuss.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
