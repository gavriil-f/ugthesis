What truth, if any, in foundationalist accounts? Is there any hope of reconciling the two views? 2014\t2a\tScepticism & Contextualism\tAre there any reasons to think that ‘know’ is context-sensitive, other than its potentially affording a response to scepticism? 2014\t2b\tScepticism & Contextualism\t‘The best responses to the problem of external world scepticism ultimately concede a lot to the sceptic.’ Discuss. 2014\t3\tAnalysis of Knowledge\t‘Externalist accounts of knowledge implausibly imply that a subject can know that P even if they are being unreasonable in believing that P.’ Is this so? 2014\t4\tAnalysis of knowledge\t‘It’s too easy to come up with counterexamples to putative analyses of knowledge in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, so we should abandon the attempt to construct such analyses.’ Is this a compelling argument? And should we give up the project of analysing knowledge? 2014\t5\tA Priori Knowledge, Self-Knowledge, & Luminosity\tDo accounts of a priori knowledge have a problem with explaining how there can be contingent a priori claims? 2014\t6\tInduction & Probability\tWhat would it take to solve the problem of induction? 2014\t7\tPerceptual Knowlede\tWhat kind(s) of relation(s) hold between Fred and a fig when Fred sees a fig? 2014\t8\tPerceptual Knowlede\tIs there any interesting sense in which colours are mind-dependent? 2014\t9\tTime\tIs memory a matter of having access to the past? If so, how is such access possible? 2014\t10\tScepticism & Contextualism\tIs there any plausible account of the nature of mind which would make knowledge of other minds possible? Does an acceptable account of mind have to make such knowledge possible? 2014\t11\tInduction & Probability\t‘Bayesianism offers no illumination on any of the traditional problems of epistemology, since it classes them all under “choice of prior”.’ Is this a valid criticism of Bayesianism? 2014\t12\tPersistence & Identity\tDoes the psychological view of personal identity face challenges that other views on personal identity easily avoid? 2014\t13\tTime\tIn what sense, if any, does time flow in a particular direction? 2014\t14\tPersistence & Identity\tWhat is the best account of how objects can gain or lose parts over time? 2014\t15\tModality\t‘Jane studies philosophy, but she could have studied history.’ Should such claims be understood in terms of possible worlds? 2014\t16\tProperties & Kinds\tDo we need to postulate the existence of properties in order to explain how objects can resemble each other? 2014\t17\tCausation\tIs backwards causation possible on a Humean account of causation? Does your answer tell for, or against, the Humean account? 2014\t18\tScepticism & Contextualism\tDo we have any good evidence that there are any mind-independent facts? 2014\t19\tConstitution & Mereology\t‘There are only two plausible views on composition: either every class of objects has a mereological sum, or no class of objects has a mereological sum.’ Discuss. 2015\t1\tScepticism & Contextualism\tCan positing variation across contexts of standards for ascribing knowledge help solve sceptical puzzles? 2015\t2a\tAnalysis of Knowledge\tWhat, if anything, is wrong with the view that knowledge is rationally held reliably true belief? 2015\t2b\tAnalysis of Knowledge\tIs knowledge the most general factive mental state? 2015\t3\tScepticism & Contextualism\t‘There are no reasons to be sceptical about the existence of other conscious persons that are not equally reasons to be sceptical about the existence of mind-independent solid objects with size, shape and location.’ Do you agree? 2015\t4\tAnalysis of Knowledge\t‘One is justified in holding a belief B only if one has some reason to think it likely to be true. A reason to think B likely to be true cannot be anything other than some other belief or beliefs that indicate the truth of B. So there is no viable foundationalism that does not collapse into a form of coherentism.’ Discuss. 2015\t5\tInduction & Probability\tAn item is grue if and only if either it is observed before a certain time T and is green, or it is not observed before T and is blue. Suppose that over 10,000 emeralds have been observed prior to time T and all were grue. Should one on that basis expect the first emerald observed after T to be grue? 2015\t6a\tA Priori Knowledge, Self-Knowledge, & Luminosity\tAre there any contingent truths that are knowable a priori? 2015\t6b\tA Priori Knowledge, Self-Knowledge, & Luminosity\tDoes an appeal to intellectual intuition play a role in explaining how we are able to have a priori knowledge? 2015\t7\tPerceptual Knowlede\tWhat is the significance of the possibility of perceptual illusions for the epistemology of perception? 2015\t8a\tTestimony, Disagreement, & Epistemic Injustice\t‘Understanding other people’s eye-witness accounts affords one epistemic access to states of affairs they have observed and now report, in much the same way that one’s memory affords one present access to past states of affairs which one oneself once observed.’ Discuss. 2015\t8b\tTestimony, Disagreement, & Epistemic Injustice\tTo what extent does one’s dependence on others for much of what one knows compromise one’s ability to take responsibility for one’s own beliefs? 2015\t9\tTestimony, Disagreement, & Epistemic Injustice\tIs there a distinct phenomenon of epistemic injustice? 2015\t10\tPersistence & Identity\tDo psychological factors have the upper hand in accommodating our intuitions about when persons persist over time? Are psychological factors dominant in determining our intuitions regarding what it takes for a person to persist over time? 2015\t11a\tConstitution & Mereology\t‘Consider a headless statue called “HEADLESS”. Suppose that at some later time T HEADLESS has been augmented by attaching a head to it. Call the whole statue after this augmentation “HEADY”. Consider the portion of HEADY consisting of the whole statue except for its head, and call that object “HEADY-MINUS”. On the one hand, we should say that HEADLESS has gained a head and is thus identical to HEADY. On the other hand, we should say that HEADLESS is identical to HEADYMINUS. But these statements cannot both be true.’ How should this quandary be resolved? 2015\t11b\tPersistence & Identity\tAre there any good reasons to prefer the view that objects persist by perduring rather than by enduring? 2015\t12\tConstitution & Mereology\tIs there a useful distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic properties? 2015\t13\tModality\t‘No individual exists in more than one possible world, so possible worlds are of no use in accounting for possibility and necessity claims concerning particular individuals.’ Discuss. 2015\t14\tCausation\tCritically compare two or more alternative accounts of causation. 2015\t15\tConstitution & Mereology\t‘There is no good solution to the special composition question. So we should accept universalism about composition.’ Is this a good argument? 2015\t16\t\tCan the claim that an object is disposed to M when C be explained in counterfactual terms? 2015\t17\t\tIs there any interesting distinction between properties such as colour and taste versus properties such as shape and mass? 2015\t18\t\tIs time travel possible? What does this tell us about the nature of time? 2015\t19\t\tWhat is the best methodology for resolving ontological disputes? 2016\t1\t\t‘This sceptical doubt…with respect to…the senses, is a malady, which can never be radically cur’d, but must return upon us every moment.’ (HUME) Is it rational, or is it a pathology, constantly to doubt the veracity of one’s senses? 2016\t2a\t\tHow important is the concept of luck in epistemology? 2016\t2b\t\tIs knowledge prior to belief? 2016\t3\t\tIs there any reason to think that ‘knows’ is context sensitive? What significance would it have for epistemology if this were so? 2016\t4\t\tShould one try to ensure one’s beliefs rest on certain foundations? 2016\t5\t\t‘In perception one is directly aware of mind-independent objects with size, shape and other perceptible qualities.’ Is there compelling reason to abandon this common sense view? 2016\t6\t\t‘To say that valid predictions are those based on past regularities, without being able to say which regularities, is…pointless.’ (GOODMAN) How does this remark bear on the problem of what justifies us in making inferences from a finite number of instances to a general law subsuming these instances? 2016\t7\t\tAre all the propositions knowable by humans either ‘matters of fact’, or ‘relations of ideas’, as Hume maintained? 2016\t8\t\t‘One’s knowledge that other conscious persons exist broadly similar to oneself is based on an inference to the best explanation.’ Do you agree? 2016\t9\t\tHow readily should one believe what others tell one? 2016\t10\t\tWhat is epistemic injustice? 2016\t11\t\tShould we explain causation in terms of counterfactuals, counterfactuals in terms of causation, or neither? 2016\t12\t\t‘The following two claims are in tension: (1) There can be change over time; (2) At least some non-essential properties of objects are intrinsic.’ Explain how this tension might most plausibly be thought to arise. How would you propose to resolve it? 2016\t13\t\t‘There are at least as many distinct sets of conditions under which objects compose to form another as there are distinct kinds of composite object.’ What can be said in favour of this view? Is it correct? 2016\t14\t\tWhat is involved in person A at time t1 being identical with person B at another time, t2? Is this a metaphysical question, a moral question, or something else? 2016\t15\t\t‘Facts are what statements (when true) state.’ (STRAWSON) Would this contention render facts implausibly dependent on what we do, and can, say? 2016\t16\t\t‘It is manifest in our experience that time passes.’ Is this so? What follows for how we should understand the nature of time? 2016\t17a\t\t‘The best explanation for the similarity of various metals is that they all contain free electrons. The best explanation for the similarity of various cubic things is that they all instantiate the universal cubicity.’ Are these claims on a par? Does the latter give us good reason to believe that the universal cubicity exists? 2016\t17b\t\t‘All categorisation of things into kinds depends upon the interests, purposes, and technological ability of those doing the categorising. So there is at best only a difference of degree between social kinds and natural kinds.’ What, if anything, is correct about this claim? What significance does your answer have for the debate over the reality of race? 2016\t18\t\tCan there be spatial points which bear no spatial relations to some other spatial points? 2016\t19\t\t‘If possible worlds are needed to explain modality, it is better not to explain modality.’ Do you agree? 2016\t20\t\tWhat is the distinction, or alleged distinction, between primary and secondary qualities? Are there any good reasons to conclude that secondary qualities do not exist? 2017\t1\t\t\"Is scepticism about other minds fundamentally different from skepticism about the external world?\" 2017\t2\t\tAre there unanalysable factive mental states? 2017\t3\t\tDoes externalism about justification imply that one can have knowledge despite disregarding available evidence? 2017\t4\t\tCan one acquire a priori justification by means of testimony? 2017\t5\t\tCan one provide a foundationalist justification for foundationalism itself? 2017\t6\t\tIs someone who is committing an epistemic injustice epistemically irresponsible? 2017\t7\t\tDoes the context-sensitivity of the word ‘know’ tell us anything about knowledge itself? 2017\t8\t\tGiven that light travels at a finite speed, does this imply that we do not visually perceive how things are now but how they were? 2017\t9a\t\tCan induction inform us about the past? 2017\t9b\t\tCan it ever be the case that the observation of a non-raven confirms ‘All ravens are black’ to a greater extent than does the observation of a black raven? 2017\t10\t\tIs the property of being-F-at-t a relational property? How does this affect the argument from temporary intrinsics? 2017\t11\t\tIs it easier to survive fission than to survive fusion? 2017\t12\t\t‘It is not vague how many things exist. Therefore, it cannot be vague whether composition occurs.’ Does this establish that composition cannot be vague? 2017\t13\t\tIf x prevents y from preventing c from causing e, does this make x a cause of e? 2017\t14\t\tCan modality be understood in terms of possible worlds, or does the notion of a possible world presuppose a prior understanding of modality? 2017\t15\t\tAre there any fundamental negative facts? 2017\t16\t\tAre races social kinds or natural kinds? 2017\t17\t\tWhen x instantiates F, is there a relation of instantiation that is instantiated by x and F? 2017\t18\t\tIs it possible that an object that is disposed to M when S does not in fact M when S? If so, does this refute counterfactual analyses of dispositions? 2017\t19a\t\tIs backward time travel possible if, and only if, time is circular? 2017\t19b\t\tWhy does time, but not space, seem to pass? 2018\t1a\t\tAre there any mental states such that one is always in a position to know whether one is in them? 2018\t1b\t\tDo you have the same evidence as your brain-in-a-vat counterpart? 2018\t2a\t\tIs epistemology a pastime which destroys its own subject matter? 2018\t2b\t\t In what sense, if any, does knowledge depend on practical interests? 2018\t3\t\t‘One sees if and only if the scene before one’s eyes causes matching visual experience.’ Discuss. 2018\t4\t\t‘A belief is justified only if it is justified by a mental state with propositional content. The only mental states with propositional content are beliefs. Therefore, immediate justification is impossible.’ Discuss. 2018\t5\t\tIn what sense, if any, is a priori knowledge justified ‘independently of experience’? 2018\t6\t\tDoes the best explanation of observed regularities imply the existence of unobserved regularities? 2018\t7\t\tCan two epistemic peers with the same evidence rationally disagree? 2018\t8\t\tHow, if at all, do the attitudes you ought to have at a time depend on the attitudes you have at other times? 2018\t9\t\tMust S know that p for T to know that p on S’s say-so? 2018\t10\t\t‘Epistemic injustice is just the unjust distribution of epistemic goods. Therefore, there is no distinctive phenomenon of epistemic injustice.’ Discuss. 2018\t11\t\tIs it ever true to say of two atoms that they once were, or will be, numerically identical? 2018\t12\t\tAre you an animal? What, if anything, does your answer imply about the metaphysics of personal identity through time? 2018\t13a\t\tAre there tables or only atoms arranged table-wise? 2018\t13b\t\tIs it possible for objects of the same kind to coincide? 2018\t14\t\t‘While the past seems settled, the future seems open.’ What is the best explanation of this apparent asymmetry? 2018\t15\t\tAre necessarily co-extensive properties identical? 2018\t16\t\tWhat might it mean to say that a kind is ‘socially constructed’? Are racial kinds socially constructed in this sense? 2018\t17\t\t‘There could have been no concrete objects. Therefore, possible worlds are not concrete objects.’ Discuss. 2018\t18\t\tIf a short-circuit starts a house fire, which triggers a sprinkler system that puts out the fire, did the short-circuit cause the failure of the house to burn down? 2018\t19\t\tAre any dispositions extrinsic? 2018\t20\t\tWhat, if anything, ground truths about what grounds what? 2019\t1a\t\tCan knowledge be analysed as true belief arrived at through the exercise of epistemic virtue? 2019\t1b\t\t‘Externalism in epistemology ought to be rejected on the grounds that it allows for knowledge to be acquired through the exercise of epistemic vice.’ Discuss. 2019\t2\t\tIn order to know that p, must one’s evidence rule out all possibilities in which not-p? 2019\t3\t\t‘Sameness of normative standards is a transitive relation between cases; indistinguishability is not.’ Is this a problem for internalism? 2019\t4\t\tIs it true that just as perception is acquaintance with the present, memory is acquaintance with the past? 2019\t5\t\tDo perceptual experiences always give prima facie justification to believe their contents? 2019\t6\t\tCan we rely on deductive reasoning to extend our knowledge? 2019\t7\t\tWhat, if anything, is the difference between the way I come to know about my own mind and the way I come to know about the minds of others? 2019\t8\t\tMight whether S knows that p depend on the moral considerations against S’s believing that p? 2019\t9a\t\t‘A wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence.’ (HUME) What truth, if any, is there in this claim? 2019\t9b\t\t‘If the universe is uniform, inductive inferences are warranted. If the universe is not uniform, no non-deductive inferences are warranted. So we may as well make inductive inferences.’ Discuss. 2019\t10\t\tIf I call to mind an equilateral triangle, and by manipulating the image in my imagination come to believe that equilateral triangles have three lines of symmetry, is my belief justified a priori or a posteriori? 2019\t11\t\tWhat is the difference between an object and an event? 2019\t12\t\tIn what sense, if any, do causes necessitate their effects? 2019\t13a\t\t‘If there’s a problem of temporary intrinsics, then there’s also a problem of contingent intrinsics.’ Discuss. 2019\t13b\t\t‘Let O1 and O2 be any two spatially separated objects. Consider the fusion of O1’s temporal part between t1 and t2 and O2’s temporal part between t2 and t3. If there is such an object, it travels faster than the speed of light. So perdurantism ought to be rejected on the grounds that it is incompatible with the laws of physics.’ Is this a fair objection to perdurantism? 2019\t14a\t\t‘If time travel were possible, I could kill my own grandfather. I can’t kill my own grandfather. So time travel is impossible.’ Discuss. 2019\t14b\t\tCan any sense be made of the question of how quickly time passes? What are the consequences of your answer for the metaphysics of time? 2019\t15\t\t‘Either every class of objects has a fusion, or none do; anything else is metaphysically arbitrary.’ Discuss. 2019\t16\t\t‘Since the claim that S1 is psychologically connected with S2 presupposes that S1 and S2 are identical, the psychological-continuity account of personal identity is circular.’ Discuss. 2019\t17\t\tWhat, if anything, makes it true that there are no unicorns? 2019\t18\t\tIn what sense, if any, is the property of being red more natural than the property of being red-or-green? 2019\t19\t\t‘Race… is something to be rid of.’ (HASLANGER) Is it? 2019\t20\t\tAre there impossible worlds? 2020\t1\t\t‘Gettier cases force us to choose between (a) accepting that knowledge requires infallible justification of a kind we almost never have and (b) accepting that some beliefs amount to knowledge simply by luck.’ Do they? If so, which should we choose? 2020\t2\t\tWhat philosophical problems, if any, would a successful analysis of knowledge help us solve 2020\t3\t\t‘Since we still need an explanation for how we can “know” by ordinary standards, epistemic contextualism is no help in responding to scepticism.’ Is this a fair complaint? 2020\t4a\t\tWhat sort of a proof would be needed to establish the existence of the external world? Is such a proof possible? 2020\t4b\t\tCan your hand experiences be evidence that you have hands if you have no prior reason to think that you are not a brain in a vat? 2020\t5\t\tWhat does the argument from illusion establish, if anything? 2020\t6\t\t‘It is not possible to wrong someone epistemically; one can only be morally wronged in an epistemic context. Therefore, a specifically epistemic form of injustice does not exist.’ Is this a good argument against the existence of epistemic injustice? 2020\t7\t\tAnn knows that exactly one of Jake (a man) and Barbara (a woman) stole her phone, and that the vast majority of phone thefts are committed by men. If she has no other relevant information, would she be epistemically justified in concluding that it was Jake who stole her phone? 2020\t8\t\tIs there an inductive justification of induction that is not viciously circular? 2020\t9a\t\tHow much, if any, of our a priori knowledge can be explained by our mastery of concepts? 2020\t9b\t\t ‘A priori knowledge is not possible unless thought-processes are reliable, but the only way to establish the reliability of thought-processes is by empirical investigation; therefore, a priori knowledge is not possible.’ Discuss. 2020\t10\t\tIf two objects occupy the same place at the same time, must they share all their parts at that time? If so, does this mean that no two objects can occupy the same place at the same time? 2020\t11\t\tIs there a true but non-trivial version of the Identity of Indiscernibles? 2020\t12\t\tIs time real? 2020\t13\t\tIf every truth has a truthmaker, what are the truthmakers of negative truths? 2020\t14\t\t‘Change is not inconsistent with things having incompatible properties at different times, nor does it entail that things must have incompatible properties at the same time; therefore, there is no problem of change’. Discuss. 2020\t15\t\tCan qualitative identity be accounted for entirely in terms of resemblance? 2020\t16\t\tDoes the metaphysician need the relation of grounding over and above the relation of supervenience? 2020\t17\t\t‘Composite things are explanatorily redundant; therefore no things compose any thing.’ Discuss. 2020\t18\t\tIs there a best account of persistence over time? If so, what is it? 2020\t19\t\tWhat are possible worlds? How do they help, if they do, in accounting for modality? 2020\t20\t\t‘Race isn't real. Hence, anti-racist politics is doomed.’ Discuss. 2021\t1\t\t‘Knowledge can’t be analysed; but the various conditions that feature in the unsuccessful analyses nonetheless capture everything that is valuable about knowledge.’ Is this a fair assessment? 2021\t2\t\t‘Even when p entails q, there can be evidence for p that is not evidence for q. So beliefs formed by deduction from things we know needn’t themselves be knowledge.’ Is this a compelling argument? 2021\t3\t\tIf the epistemic standards governing assertion are lower in an informal conversation than in a courtroom or at a scientific conference, does this support epistemic contextualism? 2021\t4a\t\t‘But it would be morally awful to believe that!’ Is this ever relevant to whether a belief is epistemically justified? 2021\t4b\t\t‘All that matters to justification is how likely the claim is to be true.’ Is this correct? 2021\t5\t\t‘Internalism about epistemic justification is well-motivated only if our knowledge of our own minds is special in way X. But our knowledge of our own minds is not special in way X.’ Is there a compelling version of this argument? 2021\t6a\t\t‘Evidence E can justify someone in believing P, only if they have prior justification to reject the conjunction (E and not-P). Our perceptual evidence can, in fact, justify us in believing a host of things about the external world. So we must have a priori justification to reject a wide range of substantive and highly contingent hypotheses.’ Is this a good argument? 2021\t6b\t\t‘Most a priori knowledge is a mystery. So there is no good argument against the view that we simply know a priori that our perceptual faculties are reliable.’ Discuss. 2021\t7\t\tShould perceptual and inductive scepticism receive parallel responses? 2021\t8\t\tIs eavesdropping a way of gaining knowledge by testimony? 2021\t9\t\tDoes it matter if you are not taken seriously as a knower? 2021\t10\t\tDoes time pass at a particular rate? What follows if it doesn’t? 2021\t11\t\tCould any two distinct things have been identical? 2021\t12\t\t‘The only mode of composition is mereological composition.’ Is this true? 2021\t13\t\tAre you a sum of temporal parts, an instantaneous temporal part of such a sum, or neither? 2021\t14\t\tSuppose every day I replace one of the parts of my watch, W, and I keep the replaced parts in a box. Once I have replaced all the parts, I have a working watch, W*, that is spatiotemporally continuous with W. Suppose a couple of days later I take the original parts out of the box and assemble them together in the original way, thereby getting a watch, W**, with the original parts of W. Which one, if either, is W, the watch spatiotemporally continuous with it, or the watch with its original parts? 2021\t15\t\t‘Theories that reject universals face a vicious infinite regress of resemblances. Therefore, at least a universal of resemblance must be accepted. And once this universal is accepted, there is no reason to develop theories that reject universals such as redness and squareness.’ Is this a good point against resemblance theories? 2021\t16\t\tShould we explain essence in terms of necessity, or necessity in terms of essence? 2021\t17\t\tDoes the truth predicate stand for a property? If so, which one? 2021\t18\t\t‘It can be true that you used to be a person but it can never be true that you used to be an animal.’ Is this right? Is it relevant to questions of our identity? 2021\t19\t\t‘Given that the modal is grounded in the non-modal, we should explain counterfactuals in terms of causation rather than vice versa.’ Is this correct? 2021\t20\t\t‘It doesn’t matter whether race is real or not – what matters is only what we believe about it.’ Discuss. 2022\t1\t\tIn what sense, if any, is knowing something incompatible with its being merely a matter of luck that one’s belief is true? 2022\t2a\t\t Is it easier to raise the epistemic standards governing assertion than it is to lower them? 2022\t2b\t\t‘If the word “know” picks out different relations governed by different epistemic standards in different contexts, then it doesn’t matter whether S can truly be described as “knowing” that p in our context; all that matters is which of those epistemic standards S actually met with respect to p.’ Discuss. 2022\t3\t\t‘[T]estimonial injustice demotes the speaker from informant to source of information, from subject to object. This reveals the intrinsic harm of testimonial injustice as epistemic objectification: when a hearer undermines a speaker in her capacity as a giver of knowledge, the speaker is epistemically objectified.’ (FRICKER) Discuss. 2022\t4a\t\tCan an externalist explain the value of having justified beliefs? 2022\t4b\t\tWhen internalists say that justification supervenes on the internal facts, what should they be understood as meaning by ‘internal facts’? 2022\t5a\t\tDoes a good response to scepticism have to start from premises which the sceptic would accept? 2022\t5b\t\t‘I know that p; hence I know that any evidence I’ll receive in the future for not-p will be misleading.’ What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning? 2022\t6\t\tCould one come to know that p is a law of nature merely by observing enough of its instances? 2022\t7\t\t‘Perceptual experience is the testimony of the senses.’ How strong is this analogy between the epistemologies of perception and testimony? 2022\t8\t\tCan you learn anything by consulting others whom you know to have the same evidence as you do? 2022\t9\t\t‘All a priori knowledge is knowledge of conceptual truths’. Is there a defensible version of this view? 2022\t10\t\t‘Lois Lane knows that Superman can fly. Superman is Clark Kent. So Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent can fly.’ What, if anything, is wrong with this argument? 2022\t11a\t\t‘The B-theorist cannot account for genuine change, since according to them what’s going on in the 4-dimensional block universe is fixed for all time.’ Is this a fair objection to the B-theory? 2022\t11b\t\tIs it possible to change the past?
